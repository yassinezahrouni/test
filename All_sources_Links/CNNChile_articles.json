A broad majority feel the president isn’t doing enough to address the high prices of everyday goods.

        "Article Text": "US President Donald Trump’s push to end the war in Ukraine appears poised to hand key concessions to Russia, leaving Kyiv and its European supporters on the sidelines as they face the prospect of a peace deal made over their heads.\n\nBut they aren’t the only major players grappling with the fallout of Trump’s pivot to Russia that has upended years of US foreign policy in a burst of rapid-fire diplomacy.\n\nIn Beijing, too, the breakneck turn of events is seen to be raising questions about how the US peace drive will impact Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s carefully wrought partnership with Russian President Vladimir Putin – and China’s precarious relations with the Trump administration.\n\nJust weeks ago, China appeared set for a key role in Trump’s Ukraine peace efforts. The US leader had repeatedly suggested he could work with Xi, using China’s economic sway over Russia to help end the conflict – important leverage for Beijing as it aims to avert a trade war with the world’s largest economy.\n\n"

After joining the Los Angeles Dodgers last winter, Shohei Ohtani bought a Porsche for the wife of relief pitcher Joe Kelly.\n\nSoto can certainly afford to go above and beyond to display his gratitude toward Baty. His $765 million contract with the Mets pays him $121.9 million for 2025 between his salary and a sizable signing bonus.\n\nThe four-time All-Star could purchase an entire fleet of SUVs for Baty and it wouldn't be a drop in the bucket in terms of his bank account.\n\nBaty, on the other hand, would've had to save up to get a car this luxurious. He's making $800,000 for this season and still has another year before he's eligible for arbitration in 2027.\n\nTh"
