Accumulations of 20-40 mm are expected fairly widely across the warning area, with the heaviest rain over high ground, especially over south or southwest-facing upslopes. As much as 70-100 mm may fall over Dartmoor. Rain will also be accompanied by strong south to southwesterly winds, making for poor travel conditions.  What Should I Do?

Give yourself the best chance of avoiding delays by checking road conditions if driving, or bus and train timetables, amending your travel plans if necessary.

In addition, strong south to southwesterly winds will also accompany the rain.  What Should I Do?  Keep yourself and others safe; prepare to avoid travelling by road during potentially dangerous road conditions. If you must travel, ensure you watch for possible danger and drive cautiously.    It is not safe to drive, walk or swim through floodwater, avoid it where possible and if you are affected by fast flowing or deep-water call 999, and wait for help.   Preparing a flood kit could save you from loss or damage due to flooding to your home or business.  In your flood kit have: insurance and any other important documents; a torch & spare batteries; a first aid kit, prescription medicines and supplies for looking after your family members or pets; and warm, waterproof clothes, blankets, food and water.   Consider checking on vulnerable people that you know including older people, those with underlying conditions and those who live alone; they may need support with food and medical supplies. If you are worried about your health or that of somebody you know, ring NHS 111.
