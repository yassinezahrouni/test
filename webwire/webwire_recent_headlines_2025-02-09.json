The award, endowed with a cash prize of 7,500 is sponsored by Fintage House and will be presented during the Kick-Off event on February 12, 2025.\nTanja Meissner, director ofBerlinale Pro*: I wanted to introduce an award within theEFMto recognise the crucial societal and cultural value of the work of European Arthouse Distributors which is often undervalued. While awards mostly go to filmmakers and producers, films only truly exist once theyre distributed and reach their intended audiences. We often discuss the importance of fostering cultural exchange by upholding diversity and showing different perspectives, and cinema has a really powerful role to play in that. Arthouse Distributors contribute not only culturally, but also economically and politically by reinforcing the foundation of European democracy.\nVaucia Pahlad, COO of Fintage House: At Fintage House, we know the magic of making a great film, and as industry professionals, we recognise the immense effort it takes to get that film to the screen.

By sponsoring the Distributor Award, we celebrate the hard work, resilience, and vision that go into bridging the gap between filmmakers and audiences globally.\nThe three-member jury is composed of renowned industry representatives Leila Hamid (CEO X-Verleih AG), Nathalie Jeung (Head of Sales Kinology) and Kim Foss (CEO Camera Film), who emphasise: We wouldnt have cultural diversity without distributors, and this recognition goes out to a whole sector of the film business. So we are rewarding one distributor, but there are many others that are more than worthy.\nHuub Roelvink from Cherry Pickers Film Distribution in the Netherlands might be working in one of the most thriving territories of them all, but that also means harsh competition for content  with steeper prices than in many other territories.In his approach to curation, Huub demonstrates a careful balance of passion and pragmatism. He evaluates films based on their artistic merit and their potential to engage viewers, understanding that successful distribution requires both quality content and audienceappeal.Huubembodies the spirit of innovation and dedication that this award honours.

After early international success in front of the camera acting in Alf SjöbergsTorment(1944) and Ingmar BergmansMusic in Darkness(1948), Zetterlings curious (and iconoclastic) sensibility led her to directing. From her incendiary debut featureLoving Couples(1964) onward, Zetterlings bracingly frank depictions of womens health, sexuality, and gender roles would be criticized and sometimes censored, but have emerged as a singular and fearless body of work that remains as transgressively urgent and necessary as it did then.Unknown Legend: Binka ZhelyazkovaMarch 726Banned and lauded, Binka Zhelyazkova was a singular voice in Eastern European cinema. This retrospective highlights her poetic, politically charged films  testaments to resistance, survival, womens agency, and defiance in occupied Bulgaria. The series includes a complete overview of Zhelyazkovas six narrative feature films including:Life Flows Quietly By...(1957);We Were Young(1961);The Tied-Up Balloon(1967), which marked Zhelyazkovas first major international screening at Montreals Expo 67;The Last Word(1973);The Swimming Pool(1977); andThe Big Night Bathe(1980).\nSee the North presented by MUBI\nMarch 11 (6:30pm):Manufactured Landscapes(2006) dir.

        "article text": "ZTE Corporation (0763.HK/000063.SZ), a global leading provider of integrated information and communication technology solutions, together with China Media Group (CMG) and China Mobile, ensured a seamless live broadcast of the 2025 Spring Festival Gala and related programs with 5G-A wireless technology.\nCMG, in collaboration with China Mobile and ZTE, has once again pushed the boundaries of live television broadcasting at the 2025 Spring Festival Gala. Building on the successful implementation of the innovative \"5G-A 4K Shallow-Compression Wireless Broadcasting\" technology, this years gala featured an expanded deployment, delivering an even more immersive viewing experience.\nCelebrating the Year of the Snake, the gala seamlessly blended Chinas rich cultural heritage with state-of-the-art broadcast technology. In a landmark collaboration, CMG partnered with industry leaders China Mobile and ZTE to refine and expand the technology, enabling robust wireless 4K camera coverage across both studio and on-location settings. This enhanced system provided audiences with unprecedented multi-angle, behind-the-scenes access, reinforcing the galas reputation for innovation and excellence.\nAdvancing 4K wireless live broadcast technology\nSince its inception in 1983, the Spring Festival Gala has chronicled Chinas remarkable journey through periods of transformation. This year, the gala not only celebrated this legacy but also showcased significant advancements in 5G-A 4K wireless broadcasting. The breakthrough was driven by two key factors:\nEnhanced creative innovation: Building on previous success, the expanded deployment now delivers even more dynamic, multi-dimensional coverage, meeting growing audience expectations for immersive, real-time experiences.\nTechnological maturation: The evolution of 5G-A wireless mobile broadcasting has enabled ultra-high reliability and image quality that rivals traditional wired systems, while ensuring secure, uninterrupted transmission.\nUtilizing shallow compression codec technology at transmission rates of up to 880 Mbps per camera, the 2025 Spring Festival Gala marked a significant leap forward, demonstrating the technologys scalability and capacity to deliver high-fidelity live coverage in real-time.\nSuperior performance breakthrough with a dedicated 5G-A private network\nThis years enhanced deployment was supported by a dedicated 5G-A private network, built on ZTEs distributed micro-stations. Achieving uplink speeds of up to 2 Gbps per camera, the network enabled seamless camera mobility throughout the venue. ZTEs proprietary 5G-A SuperMIMO technology and AI-enhanced beam tracking ensured uninterrupted streaming even during high-mobility camera movements, facilitating real-time local editing of 4K video streamed directly to the broadcasting studio.\nThe networks ultra-low latencyaveraging 4 ms at the air interface and less than 100 ms end-to-end, including encoding and decodingensured secure and efficient transmission. The system also seamlessly integrated wireless and wired setups, delivering a synchronized live broadcast for top-tier production quality.\nExpanding coverage to every corner\nThe 5G-A network not only enhanced coverage within the main studio but also extended its reach to surrounding areas. Multiple channels benefited from the systems stable performance during interviews and live segments. The technical team and directors praised the exceptional mobility, reliability, and overall performance of the wireless transmission, while audiences enjoyed a more immersive and dynamic presentation.\nBy seamlessly integrating cutting-edge technology with cultural heritage, CMG, in partnership with China Mobile and ZTE, has set a new benchmark in live broadcasting. The enhanced 5G-A 4K wireless broadcasting system at the 2025 Spring Festival Gala not only showcases the evolution of this technology but also paves the way for future innovations in the media landscape.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333800/333800-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333800\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

The expected output increases of up to 6% for each of these power plants will enable Iraqs Ministry of Electricity (MoE) to generate more electricity using the same amount of fuel.\nIn addition, as part of services and upgrade agreement announced in 2024 with MoE to enhance the availability of power plants across the country, GE Vernova completed comprehensive maintenance projects across several of these power plants corresponding to a total capacity of 3.7 gigawatts, including Qayyarah, Diwaniyah, Al-Haydariyah, and Baghdad South. These initiatives aim to enhance the long-term reliability and stability of Iraqs power sector.\nEng. Ziyad Ali Fadhil, Iraqs Minister of Electricity,said: These diverse and comprehensive projects significantly advance our goals of expanding electricity generation and enhancing energy reliability, particularly during peak demand periods. The projects also focus on improving power plant efficiency and increasing output without increased fuel consumption, leading to less carbon emissions per amount of fuel consumed. Collaborating with reputed international companies like GE Vernova is critical to achieving the Ministrys objectives and bolstering the nations power sector.\nJoseph Anis, President & CEO, Europe, Middle East & Africa, Gas Power at GE Vernova,said: \"We are proud of this ongoing collaboration to support the Ministry of Electricitys strategic objectives of enhancing power generation efficiency across Iraq and accelerating the nations energy transition efforts. The timely completion of these projects is integral to GE Vernovas commitment to modernize Iraqs energy infrastructure and support the delivery of more efficient and more sustainable energy solutions.\nIn October 2024, GE Vernova announcedthe early completion and commissioning of five critical 132-kilovolt substations across Iraq. Additionally, a sixth substation, Al Rasafa Center, was successfully energized on November 18, 2024, more than two months ahead of schedule.\nIn April 2024,GE Vernova also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Iraqi governmentin Washington, D.C., during the visit of the Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani to the United States. The MoU was signed under the patronage and in the presence of Prime Minister Al-Sudani, Deputy Prime Minister for Energy Affairs and Minister of Oil Hayan Abdul Ghani Al-Swad, and Roger Martella, Chief Corporate Officer, Chief Sustainability Officer, and Head of Government Affairs at GE Vernova.\nOver the past decade, GE Vernova has significantly contributed to the development of Iraqs energy infrastructure, adding up to 19,000 megawatts of power to the national grid. The company has also constructed 30 substations and completed the first phase of the crucial electricity grid interconnection with Jordan.

        "article text": "Tosyalı, worlds leading green steel producer with 15 million tons/year crude steel capacity, continues to expand its efforts to produce its own energy. As a part of this initiative, Tosyalı has drawn attention with its investments in renewable energy and signed an agreement with GE Vernova and Inogen for the first 120 MWp of Turkeys and the worlds one of the largest self-consumption Solar Power Plant (SPP) projects with a total capacity of 1,2 GW. The project will utilize Tosyalıs locally produced N-Type Topcon 725 Wp panels under Tosyalı V-Solar Brand.\nAs a leading global green steel producer, Tosyalı continues to invest in cutting-edge technology, artificial intelligence, renewable and clean energy sources, adhering to the principle of eco-efficiency.\nThrough its investments in clean energy sources, specifically focusing on hydrogen and solar energy, Tosyalı is making significant strides toward becoming a fully integrated green steel producer. Previously, Tosyalı achieved a global milestone by reaching 235 MW of installed capacity with its SPP project, which simultaneously covered all its facilities, making it the holder of the worlds largest rooftop solar power installation.\nNow, Tosyalı is embarking on an even larger project. In this context, the company has signed an agreement with GE Vernova and its regional provider Inogen for the first 120 MWp of the 1,2 GW self-consumption SPP project. The first project is scheduled to become operational in 2025, while the entire 1,2 GW capacity project is targeted for completion in 2027.\nFuat Tosyalı, Chairman of Tosyalı Holding, made an announcement at Davos 2025, stating: \"With this investment, Tosyalı will generate approximately 50% of its self-consumption from solar energy\"\nDuring his interview at the World Economic Forum, Fuat Tosyalı highlighted the critical role of renewable and clean energy in industrial facilities, stating, \"We continue to invest in advanced clean energy technologies under our vision of Tosyalı for a sustainable life. As part of this vision, we have taken the first step toward one of the worlds largest self-consumption SPP projects with a capacity of 1,2 GW by initiating the first project in Osmaniye. We are happy to collaborate with GE Vernova, one of the worlds leading companies in this field and Inogen, Turkeys leading EPC contractor. We will produce our own solar panels in Osmaniye. These panels, starting with the first project, will be deployed across SPP sites in eight provinces. By doing so, we aim to meet approximately 50% of our energy needs from solar energy. This will not only make us stronger and more independent in energy usage but also further strengthen our position among the worlds leading green steel producers\"\nAlthough various SPP projects have been implemented in Turkey and worldwide, Tosyalıs 1,2 GW project stands out as one of the largest self-consumption-focused projects carried out under a single umbrella. Construction for the first 120 MW project has already begun in Osmaniye. 1,2 GW self-consumption solar project will be implemented in three phases.\nAli Murat SOYDAN, Prof. Dr. Chairman of Inogen Group : We are happy to be involved in this pioneering project of Tosyalı, a symbol of green transformation in the world and in our country. When all the Tosyalı projects are completed, we will be strengthening our position as the green transformation leader in our country working with GE Vernova. In these projects, which will be carried out in 10 different provinces with more than 2000 employees, we plan to go through an efficient and fast installation process and commission all the power plants as soon as possible, with the support of our global partners.\nEd Torres, GE Vernovas Power Conversion & Storage Business Leader: \"Along with Inogen, we are proud to support Tosyalıs ambitious goal of developing one of the worlds largest self-consumption solar power projects. By supplying our advanced solar technology, providing design and engineering services, and facilitating ECA financing, we aim to help Tosyalı achieve greater energy independence and accelerate the transition toward a more resilient energy future\"\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333798/333798-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333798\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

Thats the equivalent in litres of a 20 per cent rise on the previous year.\nThis year the supermarket included a no/low brew  Lucky Saints Alcohol Free Beer - with its Finest Club Card Meal Deal offering for the first time ever and which has become very popular with customers.\nAmong the most popular no and low drinks during Dry January have been:\nDrinkaware, an independent UK alcohol education charity which helps people make better choices about their drinking said that the growth in demand for no and low drinks in the last year was very positive.\nKaren Tyrell, CEO of the charity Drinkaware said:\nIts fantastic to see the strong demand for no and low-alcohol at Christmas, not just in January.\nSwapping out alcohol for a no or low alternative is fast becoming a popular choice all year round.

        "article text": "New York State Issues Notice and Order Requiring Cleaning, Disinfection, and Temporary Closure of all Live Bird Markets in New York City, Westchester, Suffolk and Nassau Counties\nProactive Effort Will Facilitate a Break in HPAI Virus Transmission Within the Markets and Further Protect Animal and Public Health\nFollows Detection of Avian Flu at Seven Live Bird Markets in Queens, the Bronx, and Brooklyn\nBuilds on Governor Hochuls Continued Direction to State Agencies To Take Proactive Prevention Measures as Risk to Humans Remains Low\nGovernor Kathy Hochul today announced that, as part of New York States continued effort to combat the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the Department of Agriculture and Markets (AGM) has issued a new Notice and Order for live bird markets that have not had a detection of HPAI in New York City and Westchester, Suffolk, and Nassau counties. The order requires those markets to sell down all inventory, complete cleaning and disinfection procedures, and remain closed for a period of five days after cleaning and disinfection. In addition, the Notice and Order further outlines quarantine and depopulation procedures for markets that have confirmed detections of HPAI. ThisNotice and Orderfollows seven detections of HPAI in markets in Queens, the Bronx, and Brooklyn during routine surveillance conducted by AGM since January 31, 2025. The State reminds farmers to follow good biosecurity measures and emphasizes that the risk to humans remains low.\nSafeguarding public health is all about being proactive, and New York State is continuing our coordinated effort to monitor for the Avian Influenza,Governor Hochul said.My top priority will always be to keep New Yorkers safe, and I have directed our state agencies to use all available resources to ensure we are taking every measure necessary to keep the risk to the public low. We will continue to take these measured, common sense steps that will curb the spread of bird flu and ultimately protect our communities.\nNew York State Agriculture Commissioner Richard A. Ball said,Were continuing to work hard with our partners to combat the spread of HPAI in New York. Today, I signed a Notice and Order requiring that live bird markets in New York City and the surrounding areas close for cleaning and disinfection, even if they havent yet had a detection of HPAI in their market. Following seven detections of HPAI in live bird markets in the last week, this Notice and Order is a commonsense measure aimed at getting ahead of the virus, rather than chasing it. Were working with USDA and other partners to make sure that we can minimize the economic impact to these markets, and we very much appreciate the markets cooperation and assistance in protecting public and animal health.\nNew York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said,While there is no immediate threat to public health and no known cases of HPAIin humans in New York State, we support the Department of Agriculture and Markets latest proactive measures to prevent the spread of the disease between animals and humans by temporarily closing live bird markets in New York City and surrounding counties. Those who have regular contact with livestock and wild birds should safeguard their health by wearing personal protective equipment when in contact with these animals. We will remain vigilant in working with our state and local partners to monitor for detections and reduce any potential risks to public health and safety.\nNew York State Department of Environmental Conservation Interim Commissioner Sean Mahar said,Through Governor Hochuls leadership, New York State is acting aggressively to monitor for and advance actions to reduce the spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. DEC remains committed to working comprehensively with our state and federal partners to respond to HPAI and encourages New Yorkers to use our new web-based tool to report suspected HPAI outbreaks in wildlife, and follow proper precautions when handling deceased wildlife. Visit DECs website for additional information on safe wildlife handling and proper disposal techniques.\nNew York City Health Department Acting Commissioner Michelle Morse said,The current risk to New Yorkers of bird flu (H5N1) remains low. Avian influenza viruses only present a wider risk if the virus develops the ability to transmit between people  which we have not seen. The NYC Health Department will continue to work closely with the NYS Department of Agriculture and NYS Department of Health to ensure that Live Bird Market staff receive essential information and, if symptoms present themselves, receive any treatment they may need. We are prepared to respond to any disease outbreak, including quickly ramping up testing and treatment, and working closely with providers and community partners to rapidly disseminate messaging.\nHPAI is a contagious viral disease that is known to be deadly to domestic poultry and has been transmitted within and between farms and live bird markets. The temporary shutdown mandated by the Notice and Order is necessary and essential to ensuring a break in HPAI virus transmission within the impacted markets. While AGMs routine surveillance is effective, after finding seven detections of HPAI in live bird markets within the last week, the temporary shutdown ensures that the State can get ahead of any additional opportunities for transmission of the virus within the markets at the current time. A uniform market closure for a five-day period addresses the persistence and circulation of the virus within the markets by quickly reducing the virus prevalence to zero percent.\nEffective immediately, the Notice and Order requires that:\nCleaning and disinfection includes the removal of all organic debris from all equipment, caging, flooring, etc.; and requires that all surfaces be cleaned with soap or detergent, rinsed with water, and saturated with a disinfectant appropriate for killing the avian influenza virus, in accordance with the manufacturers label.\nUSDA provides indemnity and compensation for losses incurred following a confirmed detection of HPAI on a premise.\nState Senator Michelle Hinchey said,This proactive decision by NYS Agriculture and Markets to temporarily close at-risk poultry markets as a precaution against avian flu is a difficult yet necessary step to curb the spread of this highly contagious disease. New York benefits immensely from having one of the countrys top Animal Diagnostic Labs at Cornell University, which will play a critical role in limiting further spread and reducing disruptions for both farmers and businesses. We are committed to ensuring that the lab has the necessary resources to quickly respond to this and any other pathogen-based threats that may emerge.\nAssemblymember Donna Lupardo said,After detecting avian flu at seven live bird markets across NYS, the decision was made to temporarily close these markets. Proactive measures, while concerning to businesses and consumers alike, are necessary to help prevent the spread of a virus that has devastated poultry farms across the country. We are fortunate in NYS to have one of the countrys premier Animal Diagnostic Labs at Cornell University whose expertise will be invaluable as we navigate these waters.\nHPAI in Poultry\nAt Governor Hochuls direction, AGM, DOH, and DEC continue to collaborate closely on proactive measures to prevent the spread of HPAI and facilitate early detection, as the risk to humans remains low. The New York State Department of Health is also reminding the public that the finding of HPAI in this market does not present an immediate public health concern. Individuals working in the markets will be assessed for potential high-risk exposure and be monitored for symptoms by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene accordingly. If any become ill, they will be evaluated for infection with avian influenza. Since the start of 2024, there have been 67 human cases of avian influenza in the United States, and none of these have been in New York State.\nAGM encourages those involved in poultry production to take extra steps to prevent their flocks from becoming infected. All poultry producers, from small backyard to large commercial operations, should review their biosecurity plans and take precautions to protect their birds. Poultry biosecurity materials and checklists can be found on theUSDAs Defend the Flock website.\nIn addition to practicing good biosecurity, poultry owners should keep their birds away from wild ducks and geese and their droppings. Outdoor access for poultry should be limited at this time, particularly as the State continues to see HPAI detections in wild bird populations.\nTo report sick birds, unexplained high number of deaths, or sudden drop in egg production, please contact AGMs Division of Animal Industry at (518) 457-3502 or the USDA at (866) 536-7593.\nHPAI in Dairy Cattle\nIn January,AGM announced that it is implementing new testing initiatives on dairy farms as part of its aggressive, proactive response to the outbreak of HPAI in livestock in other states. Working in close collaboration with federal partners, including USDAs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, FDA, and the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, and State partners, including DOH, this enhanced testing strategy is part of the States effort to protect animal and human health and prevent the transmission of HPAI in livestock in New York State. While there have been no detections of HPAI in livestock in New York to date, the States comprehensive approach is aimed at ensuring the state remains free of HPAI and facilitating early detection.\nIn addition to the new testing initiative, New York State has taken multiple preventative measures to prevent the spread of HPAI and protect animal and human health since the first detection of HPAI in dairy cattle in Texas in March 2024. InApril,June, andAugust2024, the Department issued orders on import requirements for dairy cattle coming into New York as well as testing requirements for lactating dairy cattle entering fairs or exhibitions. These orders continue to remain in place until further notice.\nUSDA offers several producer support programs that are available to all dairy producers as well as certain programs only available to dairy producers with HPAI-positive herds. These programs include tools to support biosecurity planning and implementation as well as financial support programs to offset costs associated with HPAI testing, veterinary expenses, personal protective equipment purchases, milk disposal, and milk losses.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/333795/333795-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333795\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

Corey Rader, Manager of Floral Operations at Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia, adds, Bridal bouquets are trending on the smaller side.

Gen. Susan J. Helms, chair of ASAP. We believe that the agencys careful attention to vision, strategy, governance, and program management is vital to the safe execution of NASAs complex and critical national mission.\nThis years report reflects the panels continued focus on NASAs strategies for risk management and safety culture in an environment of growing space commercialization. Specifically, the panel cites its 2021 recommendations for NASA on preparing for future challenges in a changing landscape, including the need to evaluate NASAs approach to safety and technical risk and to evolve its role, responsibilities, and relationships with private sector and international partners.\nOverall, the panel finds NASA is continuing to make progress with respect to the agencys strategic vision, approach to governance, and integrated program management. The NASA 2040 new agencywide initiative is working to operationalize the agencys vision and strategic objectives across headquarters and centers. With the establishment of NASAs Moon to Mars Program Office in 2023, it finds NASA has implemented safety and risk management as a key focus for NASAs Artemis campaign.\nThe 2024 report provides details on the concrete actions the agency should take to fulfill its previous recommendations and spotlights its recommendations for the agency moving ahead. It addresses safety assessments for Moon to Mars and current International Space Station operations, as well as risk-related issues surrounding NASAs planned transition to commercial low Earth orbit destinations.\nIt covers relevant areas of human health and medicine in space and the impact of budget constraints and uncertainty on safety.\nThe annual report is based on the panels 2024 fact-finding and quarterly public meetings; direct observations of NASA operations and decision-making; discussions with NASA management, employees, and contractors; and the panel members experiences.\nCongress established the panel in 1968 to provide advice and make recommendations to the NASA administrator on safety matters after the 1967 Apollo 1 fire claimed the lives of three American astronauts.\nTo learn more about the ASAP, and view annual reports, visit:\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/asap\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/333786/333786-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333786\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

In addition to reducing our emissions and increasing the resilience of our operations, we help other companies to become more efficient and lower their carbon footprint. Our networks and our digital solutions are powerful enablers of the green transition.\nInternet connectivity and the use of digital technologies play a fundamental role in tacling many of todays environmental challenges, such as climate change.\nTelefónica stands out for its reduction in CO2 emissions but also for providing connectivity and digitalisation solutions that lower the carbon footprint of other sectors, including energy, transport and industry. This dual challenge is embedded across the entire Group, which is progressing towards net zero emissions by 2040 including those from its value chain  and becoming a Zero Waste company by 2030.\nTo achieve this, the telco has aGlobal Environment and Energy Policythat involves all areas and operations across the different countries where it operates.

        "article text": "The American Medical Association (AMA) is striving to revolutionize medical education with a new $12 million investment to incorporate precision education into more medical schools, residency programs, and continuing medical education for physicians. Precision education leverages data systems and technology, including Augmented Intelligence (AI), to tailor learning experiences to individual needs, optimizing learner time and focusing on targeted areas of growth. Through the AMAs groundbreaking Transforming Lifelong Learning Through Precision Education Grant Program, 10 projects will receive funding of at least $1.1 million distributed over four years. This effort will enable institutions to transform learning systems and assess and elevate competencies that matter most in serving patients.\nThis important investment underscores the AMAs commitment to advancing medical education through innovation and collaboration, said AMA President Bruce A. Scott, MD. By democratizing access to precision education, were empowering institutions of all sizes and resources to create personalized, scalable learning journeys that meet the distinct needs of future and practicing physicians and their patients.\nBy addressing the unique needs of each learner,precision educationimproves medical education from medical school through practice by boosting personalization, increasing efficiency, and transferring agency to the learner. Precision education systems offer valuable feedback in real time, helping learners stay engaged and progress at an optimal rate. Examples of precision education include:\nPrecision education is the future of medical education and, when implemented widely, will result in a more effective, efficient and equitable education model that will produce the most capable physician workforce to meet the needs of our patients in the future, said Sanjay Desai, MD, chief academic officer at the AMA.  With this new initiative, the AMA will support building and scaling tools to assess and foster competencies to help physicians thrive in medicine and improve patient care. The AMA is thrilled to increase access to precision education tools by enabling deployment, replication, and scale in diverse settings.\nOver the past decade, the AMAsChangeMedEdinitiative has invested more than $40 million in medical education innovation across the continuum. The Transforming Lifelong Learning Through Precision Education Grant Program is the result of a multi-year collaborative design process with nationally recognized experts in precision education and AI, and the distribution of smaller precision education grants that helped to define this new vision of personalized medical education.\nLearn more about the Transforming Lifelong Learning Through Precision Education Grant Program by visiting thewebsite. The call for letters of intent will open on March 18.\nThe American Medical Association is the physicians powerful ally in patient care. As the only medical association that convenes 190+ state and specialty medical societies and other critical stakeholders, the AMA represents physicians with a unified voice to all key players in health care.  The AMA leverages its strength by removing the obstacles that interfere with patient care, leading the charge to prevent chronic disease and confront public health crises and, driving the future of medicine to tackle the biggest challenges in health care.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333780/333780-1.png)\nWebWireID333780\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

This projected traffic growth will be enabled by further low-cost carrier expansion and network diversification as airlines offer more routes and destinations throughout the region.Fuel-efficient single-aisle airplanes, such as the 737 MAX, will account for nearly nine out of 10 commercial jet deliveries in the forecast period, providing airlines with greater network flexibility and better economics on fast-growing short- and medium-haul routes.

This is also a great recognition for the cooperation of INCOIS and India with the UNESCO-IOC, with INCOIS acting as a TSP for the IOTWMS, a UNESCO Category 2 Centre for training in operational oceanography as well as Decade Collaborative Centre for the Indian Ocean Region.\nSeveral recent advancements made at INCOIS act as a fine demonstration of the end-to-end ocean value chain spanning ocean observations, ocean data management, modelling and forecasting, ocean services and capacity development. These include multi-hazard early warning framework for ocean-related hazards (tsunami, storm surge, high waves, ocean climate indices, swell surges, search and rescue, oil spills, etc), State-of-the-art Synergistic Ocean Observations, Prediction and Services (SynOPS) system, Smart Access to Marine Users for ocean Data Resources and Advisories (SAMUDRA) mobile application, Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) for ocean hazards, high performance computing system for operational ocean forecasting, etc.\nINCOIS also played a key role in implementing the UNESCO-IOC Tsunami Ready recognition programme in 26 communities in Odisha State. In the future, there are plans to expand the programme to other coastal states of India, targeting more than 400 villages from the states of Odisha and Kerala by 2030. Additionally, INCOIS aims to initiate Service level 3 including tsunami inundation extents and run-up information for better decision making of disaster management officials. It also plans to deploy a cable-based observatory to improve the detection of earthquakes and identify near-source tsunamis. The warning centre will also expand its services to tsunamis generated by non-seismic sources such as volcanos. All these activities contribute to the Ocean Decade Tsunami Programme that is being coordinated under the UNESCO-IOC.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333777/333777-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333777\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "On its seventh stage, the Porsche Taycan made a stop in Malaysia as part of Join the Porsche Ride. Specifically, in Kulim, in the state of Kedah, in the north of the country.\nTogether with Porsche Asia Pacific, Porsche Malaysia represented by Sime Darby Auto Performance, and Inokom Corporation Sdn Bhd, Porsche AG launched an environmental protection program for school children at a local public elementary school in December 2024. \"As with the previous stops of Join the Porsche Ride, empowerment through education is at the center of our activities in Malaysia\" said Hannes Ruoff, CEO of Porsche Asia Pacific.\nThe focus of the program, implemented with the support of the Malaysian NGO Free Tree Society and named \"Sahabat Lestari, is not only on environmental protection qualification but also on establishing responsible behavior and integrating it into everyday school life. Heinz Alexy, Vice President Supply Chain Management and External Production, was also delighted: We have created a social project that not only inspires future generations but also empowers them for future challenges.\nIn workshops, the topics are initially introduced to the students in an age-appropriate manner. The heart of the program, among other things, includes the planting of a schools own mini jungle, which will then be maintained and cared for by the school community. As part of a 30-day challenge, the recycling of various materials from everyday school life, such as paper and plastic, will be introduced at the school. After participating, the students will receive a certificate as an Eco-Ambassador.\nTogether, we aim to make a tangible difference by seeking to generate positive environmental and social impacts with our projects while fostering change to a more sustainable future through collective efforts., added Christopher Hunter, CEO of Sime Darby Auto Performance.\nAnchoring the activities in the school allows the children not only to integrate what they have learned into their personal lives and families but also aims to expand the elementary school into a recycling hub for the community. Sui Keng Huat, Managing Director of Inokom Corporation San Bhd, also praised the program: The multi-stage approach not only creates a special learning experience but also a connection to the community and society.\nIt is also planned to expand the program to various locations across Malaysia in 2025. Carolyn Lau, Managing Director of Free Tree Society, is already looking forward to further collaboration: Together with all partners, we will achieve measurable results and successes and thus make a valuable contribution to environmental protection in Malaysia.\nFree Tree Society is a Malaysian non-governmental organization dedicated to environmental protection. The goal is to raise awareness of the need for environmental protection in Malaysia and to convey the first steps towards a more sustainable life. Various programs aim to accelerate and improve the development of a more responsible mindset and culture in Malaysia. In addition to gardening and planting workshops, topics such as waste management, rainwater harvesting, forest conservation, and biodiversity are among the topics that Free Tree Society regularly discusses with the community, which includes businesses, students of all ages, and the general public.\nJoin the Porsche Ride is a social initiative launched by Porsche, visiting various destinations on five continents worldwide. As part of the sustainability strategy field \"Partner of Society\" it is about taking social responsibility and launching educational and support programs tailored to local needsall using the all-electric Taycan as an ambassador. The power of the Taycan can also be seen symbolically here. The initiative aims to protect the environment, create good working and living conditions, and strengthen social cohesion. The first station of \"Join the Porsche Ride\" was in 2022 at the Porsche site in Leipzig. This was followed by stops in Switzerland, France, South Africa, China, and Brazil.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/333776/333776-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333776\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

This release celebrates the beauty and ingenuity of some of Americas most successful freshwater fishing lures with a colorful pane of 20 Forever stamps featuring five different, close-up photographs of five popular designs.\nThe first-day-of-issue event for the Freshwater Fishing Lures stamps is free and open to the public. News of the stamps is being shared with the hashtag#FishingLuresStamps.\nWho:\nJohn DiPeri, vice president, regional processing operations  Western Region, U.S. Postal Service\nWhen:\nThursday, March 13, 2025, at 11 a.m. Central\nWhere:\nBass Pro Shops, Wonders of Wildlife National Museum & Aquarium500 W. Sunshine St.Springfield, MO 65807\nRSVP:\nAttendees are required to register atusps.com/fishingluresstampsto receive free admission to Johnny Morris Wonders of Wildlife National Museum & Aquarium.\nBackground:\nFrom the earliest handmade wooden lures to modern swimbaits made of advanced materials, there are countless freshwater fishing lures available, each designed to meet the specific needs of the angler.\nCrankbaits, or plugs, are popular among anglers because they are relatively easy to use. They attract a variety of fish, including bass, walleye and pike. Their unique swimming action is generated by a plastic lip and curved body, which make the lures dive and wiggle just by reeling them in. Anglers tend to run these lures along the bottom, bouncing them off rocks, logs or other submerged structures.\nAn in-line spinner lure is made to mimic the movement of a swimming bait fish, attracting predator fish with a spinning blade and a weighted body that create vibration in the water. They often have tails dressed with feathers, animal hair or rubber skirting to attract bass, trout, pike and other species in shallow streams, deeper rivers and lakes.\nSpoon lures have been around since the 1800s and are named for their concave shape. It is believed that a blacksmith in Vermont created the first spoon lure by sawing off the handle of a spoon and attaching a hook. Spoons have remained popular because their unique movement and glimmer under water are so effective at catching fish, especially bass, pike and trout.\nTopwater lures are extremely popular and are designed to be used on the surface of the water.\nWakebaits use metal or plastic wings to create a commotion like the wake of a boat as they skim the surface. A popper has a concave face that creates a popping sound when it is pulled across the water.\nGreg Breeding, an art director for USPS, designed the stamps using original photographs by Sarah Cramer Shields.\nAs Forever stamps, Freshwater Fishing Lures will always be equal in value to the current First-Class Mail 1-ounce price.\nPostal Products\nCustomers may purchase stamps and other philatelic products through thePostal Storeatusps.com/shopstamps, by calling 844-737-7826, by mail throughUSA Philatelicor at Post Office locations nationwide. For officially licensed stamp products, shop theUSPS Officially Licensed Collection on Amazon.

        "article text": "The National Football League will play its first-ever regular season game in Dublin, Ireland in 2025 as the league continues to expand its global footprint and take the game to new audiences around the world.\nThe 2025 NFL Dublin game will take place at Croke Park  the largest sporting arena in Ireland and headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA)  in partnership with the Government of Ireland and Dublin City Council (Dublin City).\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers will play as the designated team for the historic first game. Steelers president Art Rooney II and his family have a rich history and deep connection with the Island of Ireland, having family from Newry, County Down. The late Dan M. Rooney, Art Rooneys father, served as U.S. ambassador to Ireland from 2009-2012 and was a co-founder of the Ireland Funds charity.\nThe Steelers are also one of only two NFL teams to have played a game in Ireland to date, a preseason matchup in 1997 against the Chicago Bears at Croke Park as part of the American Bowl series.\nWe are delighted to officially bring a regular season NFL game to Ireland as part of our 2025 International Games slate, said Executive Vice President International, League Events and Club Business at the NFL Peter OReilly. Both the NFL and the Steelers franchise have deep roots and history in Ireland, and were looking forward to making our regular-season debut in Dublin, bringing our game to a large and passionate Irish fan base and underlining the NFLs commitment to global growth.\nWe are very excited to be the designated team in the first regular season game to be played in Ireland this upcoming season, said Steelers President Art Rooney II. The opportunity for the Pittsburgh Steelers to play in Ireland is truly special, not only because of the Rooney family history there, but also to play in front of the growing number of Steelers fans in Ireland. We are thrilled to be part of this historic event to represent Pittsburgh in a game that brings the NFL to the great sports fans in Ireland.\nThis is a major vote of confidence in Irelands ability to host world class events and in Dublins reputation as one of the most welcoming cities in the world, said Minister for Arts, Media, Communications, Culture and Sport Patrick ODonovan TD. Hosting a regular season NFL game in 2025 will have huge benefits for Irish tourism, the wider economy and our sports ecosystem. It will also build upon the deep cultural, family and economic ties between Ireland and the United States. I look forward to welcoming thousands of American football fans from the U.S., Europe and further afield to our shores for this historic game, and also to the ongoing collaboration with the NFL, Sport Ireland and American Football Ireland to grow American football participation in Ireland, both the tackle and flag format of the game, as part of the governments commitment to increasing the number of people regularly participating in sport and physical activity.\nCroke Park has played host to many iconic sporting moments. It is the home of the GAA and hosts the Gaelic football and hurling All-Ireland finals every year, in 2003 it held the Special Olympics Opening and Closing Ceremonies and in 1996 it held the college football game between Notre Dame and the Navy. In addition to its sporting heritage, the venue has welcomed global music icons including U2, Bruce Springsteen, Coldplay and Taylor Swift.\nWe are absolutely delighted to welcome the NFL and the Pittsburgh Steelers to Croke Park, said GAA President, Jarlath Burns. This event will not only highlight our stadiums world-class facilities but also reinforce the connections and love of sport shared between our communities. Croke Park is a proud symbol of Irelands rich sporting heritage, and hosting one of the worlds best sporting organizations is a momentous occasion for the entire country. It will be a special and unique event, celebrating the passion uniting two great sporting codes in the heart of Dublin.\nThe full matchup including opposition, date and kickoff time will be announced when the 2025 NFL schedule is revealed this spring.\nFans can register for information around the 2025 NFL Dublin game here:www.nfl.com/dublin\nIn addition to the NFL International Games, the league is committed to growing the game at every level on the Island of Ireland, engaging with fans year-round through partners, programs and initiatives.\nThe NFLs Global Market Program (GMP), which awards teams marketing rights in international markets to grow fandom, commercial opportunities and brand awareness, sees three teams active in the Irish market  the Steelers, the New York Jets and the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nThe leagues official youth flag football program, NFL Flag, was launched in Ireland in 2024 in partnership with American Football Ireland (AFI). In the first-ever NFL Flag National Championships, Green Lanes School from Dublin were crowned champions and traveled to the 2025 NFL Pro Bowl Games in Orlando, Florida last week to represent Ireland in the International Championships, showcasing the leagues efforts to increase participation and inspire the next generation.\nBeginning in 2025, the NFL can schedule up to eight league-operated regular season games internationally.\nThe NFL will play two regular season games in London at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium  the only purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the U.S.  featuring the New York Jets and the Cleveland Browns as designated teams.\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars will also return to Wembley Stadium in London to operate a home game, their 14thin the city, as part of their multi-year commitment to playing a game in the U.K.\nThe league will also host one game in Berlin, Germany at the Olympic Stadium Berlin, with the Indianapolis Colts as the designated team and one game in Madrid, Spain at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium  Home to Real Madrid C.F., featuring the Miami Dolphins.\nThis week at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, the NFL also announced its first regular season game for the 2026 season, in Melbourne, Australia.

        "article text": "Equipping a first ship is a significant step forward in the development of WISAMO, Michelins solution, which aims to support the decarbonization of the maritime sector.\nWISAMO reaches a major milestone in its development with the signing of a first commercial contract to equip a new patrol vessel with a low-environmental-impact for the DGAMPA.\nWISAMO, the Socarenam shipyards, and the Mauric naval architecture firm are joining forces for this 100% French collaboration.\nA fresh illustration of Michelins leadership in innovation\nWISAMO, Michelins wingsail that addresses the challenges of decarbonizing maritime transport, has reached a pivotal point in its development. The DGAMPA has selected Michelin and Socarenam to design, build, and equip an innovative offshore patrol vessel with an unprecedented combination of hybrid and wind-assisted propulsion.\nA Made in France collaboration\nThis new patrol vessel project  the successor to theIris, which was designed nearly 40 years ago  is the result of a collaboration between three French companies:  Mauric, the naval architecture firm responsible for the design; Socarenam, the shipyard in charge of construction; and Michelin, which will equip the vessel with an innovative WISAMO wind propulsion technology.\nThe WISAMO wingsail, with a surface area of 170 m²/1,829 ft², will provide additional wind-assisted propulsion to complement the hybrid diesel-electric system. A fuel consumption reduction of approximately 15% is expected through optimizations of the design and the vessels operational profile. These unique features have made it possible to meet the DGMPAs expectations in terms of environmental performance without impacting the ships operations and without limiting its intervention capabilities.\nWISAMO will be involved with the architectural firm and shipyard from the ships early design and development phases in 2025. It will also follow up on the onboard installation, scheduled for early 2027, until the full handover of the equipment. The Michelin teams will also be present for the sea trials, expected to take place at the end of that same year.\nA key milestone in WISAMOs ambitious development plan\nThis trust in the WISAMO wingsail for this next-generation patrol vessel validates the technological choices for this solution. Indeed, its ease of use and fully retractable design make it a true Swiss Army knife of wind propulsion.\nIn the coming years, WISAMO aims to develop a broad range of wingsails to support the decarbonization of all types of ships, including sizeable vessels (large pleasure craft and work or cargo vessels, from 60 feet to 60 meters).\nEquipping a first ship is a significant step forward in the development of WISAMO, Michelins solution, which aims to support the decarbonization of the maritime sector. This contract not only validates the relevance of our technological choices and the robustness of our solution but also reinforces Michelins pioneering spirit.\nMaude Portigliatti\nBusiness Director of Polymer Composite Solutions and member of the Groups Executive CommitteeWISAMO, an innovative solution that adapts to all types of ships\nWISAMO offers an innovative, pragmatic solution to provide for todays continually evolving maritime context. The concept consists of a telescopic, inflatable wingsail that harnesses the cost-free predictable energy of the wind to propel ships. It includes an intuitive, automated control system and a simplified interface that greatly reduces the shortcomings of vessel integration. Adaptable to a wide range of ships over 15 to 20 meters, Michelins WISAMO wingsail can be used as a primary propulsion system or in a hybrid configuration providing additional energy to supplement the engine.\nWISAMO makes it possible to reduce fuel consumption through wind propulsion with its system based on three key components:\nA self-supporting telescopic mast that is fully retractable, allowing it to be deployed or stowed as needed.\nA durable lightweight fabric envelope that is inflated at low pressure to form a symmetrical wingsail profile.\nA fully automated control system that manages all sail functions (hoisting, lowering, adjusting, maneuvering, reefing, and protective stowage according to environmental conditions), eliminating the need for additional crew workload.\nThe ship\nThis new patrol vessel will be assigned maritime surveillance within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), monitoring vessels of all sizes and supporting the French governments maritime operations.\nBeyond the surveillance and regulatory enforcement of fisheries, it will also ensure navigation monitoring, maritime pollution control, environmental law enforcement, and search-and-rescue operations.\nIt will be based in La Rochelle and operated along the Atlantic coast, particularly in the Bay of Biscay. This is where the WISAMO was successfully tested, demonstrating the endurance of its system for several months in 2023 aboard the MN Pelican.\nMichelin, more than 130 years of leadership in innovation\nPolymer development, process engineering, high-tech material mastery, data exploitation... Since it was founded, the Michelin Group has placed innovation at the heart of its priorities. To do so, the Group relies heavily on the strength of its Research and Development. With more than 6,000 researchers worldwide, an annual innovation budget of 1.2 billion, and 11,000 active patents, the Group continues to invent solutions to enhance mobility and improve life on the move.\nPhotos : Romain SOSSO - Explore Studio\nAbout Michelin:\nMichelin is building a world-leading manufacturer of life-changing composites and experiences.\nPioneering engineered materials for more than 130 years, Michelin is uniquely positioned to make decisive contributions to human progress and to a more sustainable world.Drawing on its deep know-how in polymer composites, Michelin is constantly innovating to manufacture high-quality tires and components for critical applications in demanding fields as varied as mobility, construction, aeronautics, low-carbon energies, andhealthcare.Thecare placed in its products and deep customer knowledge inspire Michelin to offer the finest experiences.

This project, a conversion of several historic buildings on Strait Street, offers guests a harmonious blend of inspiring design and relaxed elegance in a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is truly remarkable to implement a project of this scale in such a granularly and densely built city like Valletta.\nVibrant public areas on the ground floor and a spacious rooftop terrace featuring a swimming pool and an all-day bar will grace the new Ruby Hotel, offering unparalleled views of the sea and the citys skyline including Vallettas famous St. Pauls Cathedral and Fort St. Elmo. The spaces are designed to serve as lively social hubs, providing guests with unforgettable experiences.\nValletta, often referred to as the \"Golden Capital\" due to its stunning limestone architecture, exudes an unspoiled charm that captivates visitors from around the globe. Its charming streets are lined with quaint palazzos, churches, and fortresses, each bearing the marks of time and history. As you stroll through its sloping alleys, vistas of the surrounding sea unfold, creating a picturesque backdrop for exploration. The city wears a beautiful patina of age, adding to its allure as arguably the most sought-after location in Malta.

Renovated with careful attention to detail, the space exudes character and individuality, affording visitors with an authentic and immersive experience of the citys heritage.\nAs Catherine Hilt, Associate Director Development Southern Europe at Ruby, notes: \"All of these elements perfectly align with what our guests are seeking, addressing a previously unmet demand for affordable luxury accommodation.

The last piece of the puzzle was finding a partner who shares our values. Ruby is a partner who deeply understands and respects the history and value of every piece of stone within this building while having a firm eye on what lies ahead in the international hospitality industry. We look forward to a mutually fruitful relationship for decades to come.\nThe VBL Group specializes in real estate development with an exclusive focus on Valletta. Positioned ideally for assembling this unique project, VBL over a period of several years carefully crafted this combination of historic townhouses.

        "article text": "SAS is launching new crew uniforms for its 9,000 representatives, combining Scandinavian tradition with a fresh, forward-looking design. For nearly 80 years, SAS uniforms have reflected the airlines identity as a trusted Scandinavian carrier. With a growing and diverse crew and customer base, the new uniforms embrace functionality and innovation while honoring the airlines rich heritage, symbolizing its transformation and commitment to the future.\n30 million passengers encounter SAS crew every year. For hundreds of thousands of people traveling to Scandinavia annually, they are the very first introduction to the Scandinavian aesthetic.\nUpdating the uniform policy was a significant step forward in refreshing who we are as an airline. These changes reflect a more modern expression while maintaining our commitment to professionalism, safety, and care, says Pernille Ormholt Vang, Chief People Officer at SAS.\nThe updated uniform design was created through close collaboration across departments at SAS, with insights that inspired a modern, functional, inclusive, and sustainable design  perfectly embodying SAS Scandinavian values.\nThe uniform is more than just a recognizable feature  its a vital work tool for our colleagues and an expression of our strong heritage and identity\" says Kristine Mayer, SAS Design Director. \"Uniform trends often reflect the era in which they are worn, serving as a core expression of an airlines identity. As SAS has embarked on a new and exciting chapter, its only fitting that we update our look. I believe this uniform will become iconic, representing modern Scandinavia on the global stage, as we always have.\nKey features of the uniform\nTimeless meets modern:The silhouette draws inspiration from the iconic SAS uniforms of the past, designed by legendary names like Christian Dior and Calvin Klein. It blends a modern, approachable aesthetic with premium materials and dynamic accents, creating a look that is both timeless and refreshing.\nInclusivity and individuality:Gender inclusive uniform with neutral items, optional sneakers, and allowances for visible tattoos and piercings enable team members to showcase their personality.\nSustainability in focus:Materials were chosen with longevity in mind, and some existing items will be reused or upcycled to minimize waste.\nFunctionality and adaptability:The uniform balances form and function, with pieces suited to varying roles, seasons, and weather conditions.\nEveryone in our company is unique, and its important that we create a culture where colleagues feel confident expressing their identity, says Pernille Ormholt Vang. People are at the heart of everything we do, and by welcoming greater diversity of personal expression through initiatives like our gender-neutral uniform, we believe we become more relevant to the people and communities we serve.The updated uniform builds on recent changes to SAS appearance policies, including allowances for optional sneakers, visible tattoos, and piercings. Introduced last summer, these updates reflect SAS commitment to fostering a workplace where individuality is respected and celebrated.\nThe rollout will commence in February 2025, with old and new items coexisting during a yearlong transition.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/333740/333740-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333740\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "New research by TUI Musement, the Tours & Activities division of TUI Group, suggests the majority of people are unable to distinguish between real images and those generated utilising artificial intelligence (AI). The independent study, conducted by Appinio on behalf of TUI Musement in June 2024 with 1,200 adults across all age groups in Germany, Spain and the UK, also found that AI images could have a negative impact on peoples trust, although younger consumers and men seem more positive on the topic.\nThe research was carried out as TUI ensures the ethical implementation of AI across the business, and that any application enhances the customer or colleague experience.\nAs AI evolves, it presents opportunities for the travel industry to enhance customer engagement. However, the importance of ethical AI deployment is paramount, and this type of research is key to understanding how best to integrate advanced technology while maintaining customer confidence, said Peter Ulwahn, CEO of TUI Musement. The findings from this research underscore the importance of balancing innovation with transparency. We must ensure that AI enriches the travel experience without compromising trust and our approach will remain rooted in authenticity\"\nKey Insights from the study:\nTUI does not use AI-generated destination images on its platforms today. In cases such as TUIs AI-generated influencer Lena, the destinations shown in the background are always real images. Furthermore, whenever AI is used, TUI clarifies this.\nThe research contributes to a better understanding for potential future use cases. TUI already uses AI technologies to automate and improve the management and optimisation of image content, classifying and filtering the more than 35 million images in its database, primarily hotel and room images. AI identifies and evaluates images based on technical and aesthetic criteria in order to make the best possible image selection for automated galleries and avoid duplicate or inappropriate images. It also supports keywording and categorisation by automatically assigning tags such as summer, winter or pool to images.\nFuture AI applications at TUI could include personalised descriptions, target group-relevant content and interactive travel advice for customers.\nAbout TUI Group\nThe TUI Group is one of the worlds leading tourism groups and operates worldwide. The Group is headquartered in Germany. TUI shares are listed in the MDAX index of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and in the regulated market of the Lower Saxony Stock Exchange in Hanover. TUI Group offers its 20 million customers integrated services from a single source and forms the entire tourism value chain under one roof. The Group owns over 400 hotels and resorts with premium brands such as RIU, TUI Blue and Robinson and 17 cruise ships, ranging from the MS Europa and MS Europa 2 in the luxury class and expedition ships in the HANSEATIC class to the Mein Schiff fleet of TUI Cruises and cruise ships operated by Marella Cruises in the UK. The Group also includes Europes leading tour operator brands and online marketing platforms, for example for hotel-only or flight-only offers, five airlines with more than 130 modern medium- and long-haul aircraft and around 1,200 travel agencies. In addition to expanding its core business with hotels and cruises via successful joint ventures and activities in vacation destinations, TUI is increasingly focusing on the expansion of digital platforms. The Group is transforming itself into a global tourism platform company.\nGlobal responsibility for sustainable economic, environmental and social action is at the heart of our corporate culture. With projects in 25 countries, the TUI Care Foundation initiated by TUI focuses on the positive effects of tourism, on education and training and on strengthening environmental and social standards. In this way, it supports the development of vacation destinations. The globally active TUI Care Foundation initiates projects that create new opportunities for the next generation.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/333735/333735-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333735\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Vox Media and Sensodyne announced the upcoming release ofSensory Overload,a compelling feature-length documentary exploring the needs of the neurodivergent and sensory sensitive communities and how to better serve them in a variety of settings. An estimated 20 percent of the worlds population has some form of enhanced sensitivity to environmental or emotional stimuli andSensory Overloadaims to raise awareness of the need for more sensory inclusive spaces.\nThe film profiles individuals in the neurodivergent and sensory sensitive communities and their allies, looking at how they are changing mindsets around them. It follows Lola Dada-Olley, a mother of two children on the autism spectrum; Dr. Jacob Dent, a dentist who has designed his practice with the needs of the neurodivergent and sensory sensitive communities in mind; and Burnett Grant, a young individual on the autism spectrum who advocates for more inclusive environments.\nSensory Overloadaims to showcase the characters stories and experiences without putting them in a box, at times providing a visual representation of how they experience the world, and the challenges presented in settings that can be overwhelming to the senses, such as visiting the dentist. Academy Award-winning director Spike Lee discusses his experience with dyslexia, and the better understanding that came following his sons diagnosis. Other parents in the film share how they advocate for their children and, in the case of Dr. Dent, designed a dental practice to be inclusive of the needs of these communities.\nProduced by Vox Creative, Vox Medias award-winning branded content studio, Publicis Le One  Powered by Digitas, Sensodyne, and Samantha Knowles,Sensory Overloadwas featured at BrandStorytelling in Park City, Utah on January 22, 2025 with a limited theatrical release in New York City on February 5-11 at the Village East Theater.

This year, more than 1,100 women from 17 project villages enrolled in the program and received in-depth training on good agricultural practices. This training aims to raise productivity while fostering safe, sustainable and regenerative agriculture. All participants also took part in the programs digital and financial literacy module.\nAs a widow, I carry the burden of my family on my shoulders alone. Thanks to the Pragati program, I have been able to improve my farming practices and better support my family, says Patel Sitaben Rameshbhai, a castor oil farmer from Kahoda village in Gujarats Mehsana district. The good agricultural practices I have learnt have helped me reduce the cost of cultivation by 20 to 25 percent. I have also started using certified seeds, which help me grow healthier crops and produce more. With the savings I made, I was able to buy a new machine for my sons motor repair shop. It feels like I have made real pragati  progress for me, my family and my community, adds Sitaben, who now helps her fellow farmers practice safe and sustainable castor farming.\nNext year, the Pragati program will celebrate its tenth anniversary. Launched following the completion of a baseline survey of over 1,000 castor oil farmers in Gujarat, India, the initiative identified the profitability and ease of cultivation of castor oil as key factors. Since then, the project has aimed to increase yields and farmer incomes by adopting sustainable agricultural practices, promoting good waste management practices, ensuring efficient water use, maintaining soil fertility, and implementing better health and safety measures while respecting human rights. In 2025, the achievements made over the past xears will continue to drive progress in sustainable castor oil production.\nAbout the Care Chemicals division at BASF\nBASFs Care Chemicals division offers a broad range of ingredients for personal care, home care, industrial & institutional cleaning, and technical applications.

        "article text": "- Improves smallholder mint farming with comprehensive platform approach-  Improves yields, and boosts farmers incomes and living standards-  Reinforces Symrises leadership in sustainable sourcing and climate action\nSymrise and its partners got honored with the 2024 Ecosystem Award at the AB InBev Eclipse Bold Steps Awards. It recognizes how the company empowers smallholder mint farmers in Indias northern state of Uttar Pradesh with the collaborative platform Bridging the Gap (BTG). Sustainable farming practices, advanced processing technologies, and socioeconomic development initiatives aim at positively impacting climate, nature, society, and livelihoods. This underscores the commitment of Symrise to securing a sustainable future for farmers and consumers around the globe.\nAddressing Challenges in Mint Farming\nThe award honors the commitment of Symrise in Indias northern state of Uttar Pradesh. 66% of the population relies on agriculture here. And up to one million smallholders account for75% of Indias total mint production. Symrise supports farmers in mastering their multifaceted challenges. This includessustainable water management, access to modern processing technologies, and bridging generation gaps. Succession planning and passing traditional farming knowledge can help address labor shortages, especially among women and young adults.\nThis Ecosystem Award underscores our commitment to building strong, future-proof supply chains, Bernhard Kott, Chief Sustainability Officer at Symrise. Our customers can count on reliable, ethically sourced mint, and consumers benefit from products made with ingredients grown under environmentally and socially responsible conditions.\nTransformative measures and results achieved\nSymrise has started its engagement in 2017 already, aiming to enhance crop quality, productivity, and farmer incomes. Building on its positive outcomes, Symrise and partners expanded their efforts in 2020 with the comprehensiveBridging the Gap (BTG)platform, designed to amplify benefits by sharing best practices, scaling climate-smart farming, and strengthening farmer organizations. BTG aims to securea profitable and sustainable future for rural communities.\nOver 27,000 smallholder farmers have enrolled in training and received support for Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) in this first project. As a result, mint yields increased by 32% versus control groups along with 20% lower production costs. The program also includes climate-smart measures that saved up to now 2.5 tons of CO2 and achieved a 26% reduction in water consumption. Ongoing support comes from 430 self-help groups to promote womens economic empowerment and five Farmer Producer Companies. In view of this success, Symrise has made plans for another initiative and to reach 10,000 farmers with it having started in 2024, employing a whole farm approach that boosts on-farm productivity and off-farm financial resilience.\nSecuring a sustainable supply chain\nWhen farmers adopt modern techniques, they can increase yields, reduce costs, and mitigate the environmental impacts of agriculture. This, in turn, ensures a reliable supply of premium-quality, responsibly sourced mint, offering a competitive edge for Symrises customers and greater transparency for consumers.\nWith Bridging the Gap, we are tackling the toughest challenges in mint farmingfrom erratic climate patterns to inter-generational knowledge loss, said Marie Le Henaff, TN&H Sustainability Director. Our corporate commitment to drive sustainable development in our strategic supply chains has grown in India into a powerful platform that enhances farmer livelihoods, protects natural resources, and secures a stable, high-quality supply of mint.\nLooking Ahead\nSymrise and its partners will continue implementing BTGs approach, aiming to bolstereconomic, social, and environmental resiliencein Uttar Pradesh and beyond. By fostering deeper collaboration with local communities, refining sustainable practices, and embracing digital innovations, the initiative ensures thatboth present and future generationscan benefit from profitable and responsible mint farming.\nFor Symrises customers and end consumers, BTGs success providesassurance of supply chain integrity, enhanced product quality, and positive social impact. Through this platform-driven approach, Symrise underscores its role as an industry leader, setting new benchmarks for collaborative, sustainable sourcing practices that protect livelihoods, ecosystems, and the broader markets long-term needs.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333715/333715-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333715\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "The U.S. nursing profession is increasingly focused on using Artificial Intelligence (AI), both in education and practice, to assist in tackling key hurdles facing the industry and one of the worlds largest patient populations. Many experts agree that addressing the current challenges begins at the education level. Elseviers 2023 global survey,Clinician of the Future Education Edition, showed that 51% of students were using generative AI for their studies at that time. TheDigital Education Council Global AI Student Surveyreleased late last year now puts that number at 86%.\nA key indication of this support is the latest customer insights from Sherpath AI, the first and most advanced generative AI (GAI) designed specifically for nursing students and faculty.\nSherpath AI is a groundbreaking advancement in nursing education that seamlessly integrates trusted nursing education content with GAI. Following the introduction of Sherpath AI with Sherpath courses in October 2024, more than 200 Elsevier Program Solutions institutional subscribers will gain access to Sherpath AI on February 24, 2025, expanding AI-enabled capabilities to more students and faculty.\nSherpath AI comes at a pivotal time. The U.S. is grappling with several pressing issues facing the nursing profession many of which are due to significant resource and capacity constraints at nursing institutions. Those issues pose considerable challenges for the field, namely extreme nursing shortages and a lack of clinical preparedness of graduating registered nurses, preventing the nations nursing programs from accepting enough students, and hindering progress on addressing critical priorities and challenges. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing recently reported that nearly 66,000 qualified nursing applicants were rejected from baccalaureate and graduate nursing programs due to insufficient faculty, clinical sites, classroom space, and clinical preceptors.\nSherpath AI was developed and engineered to help educational institutions overcome these challenges through:\nPersonalized Learning: tailored AI-driven responses that accelerate student learning with information from Elseviers evidenced-based research and book content.\nInteractive Dialogue: students and educators can engage in a back-and-forth exchange of questions and answers using natural language, making the learning experience more engaging.\nDiverse Resources: users can access various types of content, such as Osmosis videos and interactive materials, catering to different learning styles.\nFaculty Support: the solution generates organized summaries, provides refreshers on less frequently taught content, supports course and lesson preparation and offers alternative ways to explain difficult concepts and much more.\nDena Lam, MSN candidate at Arizona State University said: As a student in an accelerated Master of Science in Nursing program, there is an overwhelming amount of information and content for students to absorb in a short period of time. The use of AI tools like Sherpath AI not only help us consume the information but allow us to interact with the content and get precise and trusted answers to expert questions in moments. Sherpath AI has been instrumental in helping me understand complex information in a way that not only helps me excel in the program but also strengthens my foundation as a future nurse.\nDeveloped in collaboration with nursing faculty from across the country, Sherpath AI supports students and educators by simplifying tasks that would have once taken hours to complete, freeing up crucial time.\nAmy M. Hall, PhD, RN, CNE, Professor & Dean School of Nursing at Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady University said: \"Sherpath AI is helping us transform the student and faculty experience and bridge gaps facing nursing education. Combining the latest technologies with our faculty expertise and Elseviers trusted content, we are customizing our students learning to better address challenges facing our students and faculty. Through feedback from both faculty and students, its clear Sherpath AI is helping us better prepare our students for the clinical setting while assisting us in meeting the needs of tomorrow.\nThe platform has already been tested by over 3,000 instructors and 35,000 students.\nBrent Gordon, President, Nursing & Health Education at Elsevier Health said: \"Concerns about the U.S. healthcare system are only growing. Sherpath AI directly addresses the pressing needs of the nursing education community by enhancing student engagement with course materials and increasing capacity and effectiveness in the face of faculty and institutional resource constraints. The numbers show that, when used responsibly, AI is helping expand the ability of institutions to make nurses practice-ready and increase the active nurse population globally.\nTo learn more about Sherpath AI, please visit: https://www.elsevier.com/products/sherpath/sherpath-ai.\nFor more than 140 years, Elsevier has supported the work of researchers and healthcare professionals by providing current, evidence-based information that can help empower students and clinicians to provide the best healthcare possible.

        "article text": "For decades, scientists have tried to stop cancer by disabling the mutated proteins that are found in tumors. But many cancers overcome this and continue to grow.\nNow, UCSF scientists think they have figured out how to throw a wrench into the fabrication of a key protein, MYC, that drives the growth of 70% of all cancers. Unlike some other targets of cancer therapies, MYC can be dangerous simply due to its abundance.\nIn a paper that appears Feb. 4 inNature Cell Biology, researchers at UC San Francisco describe how to curb MYC levels by targeting RBM42, a separate protein that makes cells churn out MYC. They found that disrupting RBM42 in pancreatic cancer cells, one of the deadliest cancers, blocked MYC production and slowed tumor growth. The researchers now think drugs could be developed to do the same in a host of other fast-growing cancers that are driven by MYC. By blocking RBM42, such drugs would effectively block MYC.\nMYC is what we see when a cancer is resilient to anything we try to do to defeat them, saidDavide Ruggero, PhD, a professor of urology at UCSF and senior author of the paper. Now that we can see the machinery that controls the amount of MYC, there may finally be a way to stop it.\nMYC was first identified in the 1970s by UCSF Nobel Laureates Michael Bishop, MD, and Harold Varmus, MD. They found MYC while studying cancers that are caused by viruses. MYC was a normal protein that only took on a malevolent role in cancer. The discovery revolutionized cancer research and cancer care.\nUnlike other cancer-causing factors, though, cancerous MYC isnt always mutated. Cells produce MYC unceasingly to become cancerous without a mutation in the MYC gene directly. And pathologists use it as a microscopic marker for fast-growing cancers.\nEveryone knows how important MYC is for cancer, but there are no drugs to block it, saidJoanna Kovalski, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in the Ruggero Lab and first author of the paper. So, we instead looked toward how MYC is actually made.\nKovalski used a method called CRISPRi to hunt for factors that influence how much MYC was produced in cancer cells. Surprisingly, the experiment pointed to an obscure protein known as RBM42, which has not attracted much attention until now.\nPoring over genomic data from pancreatic cancer patients, Kovalski found abundant RBM42 in cells with lots of MYC. And the more RBM42 and MYC found in patients, the worse their health fared.\nKovalski and Ruggero wanted to know how RBM42 influenced the production of MYC.\nLike any protein, MYC is built using the instructions that are stored in the MYC gene. First, in a process called transcription, the cell uses these instructions to make a blueprint, called mRNA. Then, in a process called translation, the cells protein factories, called ribosomes, use this mRNA to make MYC protein.\nThe scientists were surprised by what they found. When they disrupted RBM42, the cancer cells still produced MYC mRNA but stopped producing the MYC protein. This suggested that RBM42 was only involved in the second part of the process: the translation of mRNA into protein.\nFurther experiments showed why. RBM42 reshaped the MYC mRNA blueprint to make it better for processing by ribosomes. It also directed these mRNAs to the ribosomes  which churned out copious amounts of MYC. RBM42 ensured that MYC received preferential treatment from the cells protein factories.\nProteins like RBM42 and MYC exist in every cell but are normally restrained, Ruggero said. During cancer, we saw that RBM42 behaved quite differently, hijacking the ribosomes to work with these specific mRNAs and do the cancers bidding.\nThe researchers tried interfering with RBM42 in cancer cells in petri dishes and then in mice. In both cases, when they removed RBM42 the ribosomes stopped making MYC and the pancreatic tumors stopped growing.\nRBM42 really seems to be the Achilles heel for some of the worst cancers, Ruggero said.\nKovalski, Ruggero, and their UCSF colleagues believe small molecules could intervene in this process like molecular wrenches jamming cancers gears.\nTranslation control deserves to be front and center in our efforts to treat cancer, Kovalski said. We now have great footing to interfere with the fastest-growing cancers and make a difference for patients.\nAuthors:Other UCSF authors include, Goksu Sarioglu, Vishvak Subramanyam, Grace Hernandez, Gilles Rademaker, PhD, Juan A.

        "article text": "For the sixth year running, the San Sebastian Festival publishes a report from the gender perspective in the endeavour to obtain as precise an X-ray as possible of the consideration and involvement of women professionals in the film industry. Compiling this report every year highlights a sluggishness in the incorporation of women to audiovisual productions. Scarcely any changes have been recorded compared to previous editions, although we can confirm the consolidation observed with respect to certain trends and the existence of others that are starting to make their mark.\nThe report includes all of the films viewed by the San Sebastian Festival selection committee, standing at more than 4,500, thanks to which we can obtain an overall impression of the years production. Analysed from the gender perspective, in the eight categories examined (directing, production, screenplay, cinematography, music, editing, sound and art direction) those identifying with the male gender are in the majority  with percentages ranging from 57% to 75%. This refers to all categories, with the exception of art direction. The least balanced areas are, in this order, production, screenplay, editing and directing.\nAmong the productions finally selected for the Festival, the percentages of authorship by gender are similar with respect to all films viewed; however, there are more women directors (39%), screenwriters (39%), editors (39%), sound (20%) and art directors (41%) in the crews of the selected films (3-6 percentage points higher than in the total viewed). On the other hand, there are fewer women producers (33%).\nGenerally speaking, there is a slight rise in the presence of women directors and screenwriters, a very slight increase in the number of women in the sound departments, who rarely amount to more than 20%, and a drop in the participation of women producers and editors, figures which will require analysis over time to establish whether they do in fact indicate some kind of change or are simply a passing phenomenon.\nIt is important to note that Perlak, a section showcasing the films to have enjoyed the greatest international success of the year, to have received Oscar nominations, or to have their release in commercial cinemas on the highest number of screens is, with Culinary Zinema  the section dedicated to the cinema and gastronomy  the competitive section to show, year after year, the least balanced percentages from the gender point of view, far removed from the overall figures for films viewed and selected and from the other sections.\nThe figures for Nest, a selection of short films by students from film schools all over the world, show not only parity at film schools in the fields of directing, production and screenwriting, but that the number of women cinematographers and music composers is on a par with that of professionals in the academic phase. However, this balance clearly falls apart in the professionalisation process.\nIn the field of Basque productions, the trend of recent years continues: an approximation to parity in the categories of directing and screenwriting, and a participation of women professionals higher than the Spanish and overall average.\nRegarding the representation of non-binary persons, although their presence is small in the total number of films viewed by the Festival (between 1% of sound professionals and 2% of filmmakers), it is particularly visible in some sections, linked to the early days at film school and films at the project stage and works in progress, a factor which would seem to suggest a change in the new generations of film industry professionals: non-binary persons have their representation in all of the trades analysed in Nest, the Europe-Latin America Co-Production Forum and Ikusmira Berriak, and in practically all artistic categories of WIP Latam and WIP Europa.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333710/333710-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333710\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "BP Europa SE today announced its intention to market its Ruhr Oel GmbH  BP Gelsenkirchen operation in Germany for potential sale. Its assets include the bp refinery in Gelsenkirchen and DHC Solvent Chemie GmbH in Mülheim an der Ruhr.\nThe marketing process for a suitable buyer will begin immediately with sales agreements targeted for 2025. Assuming this is successful, timing for the completion of the sale and transfer of the company to a new owner will be subject to regulatory and governmental approvals. During the sales process, the refinery will continue to operate as usual.\nEmma Delaney, EVP, customers & products said, bp needs to continually manage its global portfolio as we position to grow as a simpler, more focused, higher-value company. After a thorough review, we have concluded that a new owner would be better suited for the site to take it forward. We are convinced that the refinery can unlock its full potential under new ownership.\nIn recent years, bp has implemented numerous projects to modernize the infrastructure of the refinery in Gelsenkirchen. This includes, for example, renewing the power grid and establishing an independent steam supply. With initiatives like these, the site can meet the demands of modern refinery operations. The continued transformation of the site, initiated in 2024, aims to reduce the refinerys complexity and processing capacity. Today, the refinery can process crude oils from around the world, produce high-quality fuels and also has the potential to manufacture biofuels and process recycled plastics.\nPatrick Wendeler, chief executive of BP Europa SE, said, With significant investments, we have been able to substantially modernize our site in recent years. Due to its current production capabilities and its location  in the heart of Europe and particularly within the chemical cluster of North Rhine-Westphalia  it offers significant potential to a new owner supported by a highly qualified team.\nWith a current workforce of around 2,000 employees and 160 apprentices, Ruhr Oel GmbH  BP Gelsenkirchen (ROG) operates the two plants in Horst and Scholven in Gelsenkirchen as an integrated refining and petrochemical site, as well as the Bottrop tank farm. The refinery has a processing capacity of around twelve million tonnes of crude oil per year. This is used to produce petrol, diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, as well as more than 50 other products, primarily for the chemical industry. In addition to its major importance for the domestic fuel and energy supply, the Gelsenkirchen site also plays a key role in the North Rhine-Westphalia chemical industry.\nIn addition, ROG is the sole owner of DHC Solvent Chemie GmbH and has a share in the Maatschap Europort Terminal (MET) in the Netherlands. It also holds shares in the N.V. Rotterdam-Rijn-Pijplining (RRP) crude oil and product pipeline and Nord-West Oelleitung GmbH (NWO) with its pipelines, crude oil tanks, tank farms and unloading points.\nIn order to utilize the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the PSLRA) and the general doctrine of cautionary statements, bp is providing the following cautionary statement.\nThis document contains certain forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements  that is, statements related to future, not past events and circumstances  with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of bp and certain of the plans and objectives of bp with respect to these items.

        "article text": "With this years theme of Listen Courageously  Cinematic Narratives in Times of DissonanceBerlinale Talentsextends an invitation to its audiences not only to visit the exciting programme in HAU Hebbel am Ufer, but to actively engage, to explore new ideas, to broaden horizons and welcome new narratives; to listen, courageously, together. Taking the art of listening as the overarching focus,Berlinale Talentsstrives to encourage not only diversity in the stories we hear, but understanding and tolerance among cinema-loving audiences, guests and Talents. The programme offers 14 public talks for Berlin audiences and an extensive programme for the 200 invited Talents. Covering a wide range of cinematic disciplines, the programme invites selected filmmakers and the public to come together with internationally renowned guests for six days of exceptional events built around this years theme of Listening Courageously.\nThere is a lot worth listening to over the course of six days. Audiences wont want to miss a single word of what the festivals International Jury President Todd Haynes has to say. The award-winning director joinsBerlinale Talentsfor a career-spanning conversation as he opens up about his journey through cinema and the significance of listening courageously as an indispensable tool for great storytelling. From a leading voice of the Berlinale International Jury to a leading voice in Indigenous Cinema,Berlinale Talentswill welcome Inuk filmmaker Zacharias Kunuk to the stage. The public audience can hear all about his groundbreaking career over the last four decades; his background and craft, the rise of Indigenous Cinema and his relationship with it, and the importance of language and representation across his filmography.\nLanguage is not just words, however, and it is the often-subtle aspects, the understated intonations, that reveal more than can be said. Costume designer Bina Daigeler, also a member of this years International Jury, and production designer Inbal Weinberg have brought the worlds of many award-winning films to life, most recently in Pedro AlmodóvarsThe Room Next Door. They come together for \"Creating Your Characters World from Scratch\" to discuss visual storytelling and the importance of collaboration in their creative teams. A world, of course, is not complete without its aural landscape, and in Haunting Sounds and Deafening Silences, award-winning sound designer and filmmaker Rana Eid discusses her career, her quest to capture the soundscapes of war, the role of silence, and how her projects have helped her to hone her craft and creativity in times of conflict.\nThe contradictorily confronting volume of silence reverberates again in Reflections from the Republic of Silence with Diana El Jeiroudi and Orwa Nyrabia. Few filmmakers have proved more essential in advancing documentary cinema than this pair of multi-hyphenate artists. From Damascus, where they nurtured the vibrant community of documentary filmmakers across the Arab region as producers, film and festival makers, to more than a decade working from exile in Berlin and in a European context, the duo will reflect on their journey as film makers and creative partners, their introspective and constantly evolving sense of space and belonging, and the intersection of the personal and political levels of cinema.\nFresh from the premiere of his latest feature, the Golden Bear contenderDreams, Michel Franco joinsBerlinale Talentsfor an in-depth chat: Breaking the Rules with Michel Franco is about the collaborative nature of his craft, his work with actors both unknown and famous, and his responsibilities as a director and producer. In order to know when to follow the rules, and when to break them, a filmmaker must pay attention to their own intuition, which is a theme further explored in Listen to Your Creative Core: Why Filmmaking Needs Courage. In this talk, exceptional storytellers and ground-breaking artists, filmmaker Cheryl Dunye, producer Christine Vachon and actor-filmmaker Sara Fazilat discuss their different approaches to cinematic storytelling and the importance of staying true to ones vision and community.\nThe successful format of the TEDDY Talents Talks, a joint venture betweenBerlinale Talents, TEDDY AWARD and Queer Academy will return for a third time under the title TEDDY Talents Talks: Listen to Your Heart. This time around, an engaging panel of film professionals reflect on the boundaries they have overcome by listening courageously, and the importance of listening to their respective artistic careers. In another multi-membered panel, the International Short Film Jury will play a question-and-answer game with the audience. Drawing from their experiences on films of all lengths, they explore the many ways in which the maxim Listen Courageously has proven vital to their work.\nAll this is just a small taste of the talks and topics on offer atBerlinale Talentsthis year. The programme in its entirety can be explored atwww.berlinale-talents.de. All events are held in English. Tickets are sold exclusively online on the Berlinale website.\nBerlinale Talentsis part ofBerlinale Pro*, which unites theEuropean Film Market, theBerlinale Co-Production Market,Berlinale Talentsand theWorld Cinema Fund.Berlinale Pro*is the festivals full-circle industry infrastructure that serves the global film industry as incubator, enhancer and supporter in all stages of film development, production, sales and distribution.\nBerlinale Talentsis supported by the Minister of State for Culture and the Media, Creative Europe  MEDIA Programme of the European Union, Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, German Federal Film Board, Mastercard and ARRI.\n******\nIMAGE CAPTION:\nThe selected filmmakers of Berlinale Talents (f.l.t.r.): Top: Todd Haynes © Samir Hussein / Wire Image, Rana Eid, Michel Franco © TEOREMA, Zacharias Kunuk; Middle: Inbal Weinberg, Bina Daigeler © Pablo Zamora; Bottom: Diana El Jeiroudi & Orwa Nyrabia © Guevara Namer / No Nation Films GmbH, Christine Vachon, Cheryl Dunye © BAMPFA Events, Sara Fazilat © German Films Marcus Höhn for FACE\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333704/333704-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333704\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "As Thailands capital, Bangkok, grapples with unhealthy levels of air pollution, leading to school closures and widespread health concerns, UNICEFs latest analysis sheds light on the devastating impact of toxic air on children across East Asia and the Pacific. Air pollution, which peaks in many parts of the region during the dry season from now until April, is linked to over 100 deaths in children under five every day.\nThe analysis reveals that all children in East Asia and the Pacific  500 million children in total  live in countries with unhealthy levels of air pollution. Household air pollution, caused by solid fuels used for cooking and heating, is linked to more than half of all air pollution-related deaths in children under five. Meanwhile, 325 million children live in countries where average annual particulate matter (PM2.5) levels exceed World Health Organization (WHO) guideline levels by more than five times, and 373 million live in countries with unhealthy levels if nitrogen dioxide (NO₂). Additionally, 91 percent of children in the region  453 million  live in countries where ozone pollution exceeds WHO guideline levels. Nearly half of the PM2.5 in countries with the highest levels of this pollutant, came from the burning of fossil fuel, biomass fuel, and agriculture waste, which also generate the greenhouse gases driving climate change.\nEvery breath matters, but for too many children every breath can bring harm, said June Kunugi, UNICEF Regional Director for East Asia and the Pacific. The air they breathe, at a time when their bodies and minds are still developing, too often contains unhealthy levels of pollution that can comprise their growth, harm their lungs, and impair their cognitive development.\nAir pollution is linked to nearly one in four deaths of children under five in East Asia and the Pacific, and can impact every stage of a childs life. It begins in the womb with risks of premature delivery and low birth weight. The harm continues into early childhood, as young children breathe more rapidly and are closer to ground-level pollutants like vehicle exhaust, making them more vulnerable to asthma, lung damage, and developmental delays. The threat is often worse for low-income children living near factories or highways, where exposure to pollution is higher. Over time, air pollution can silently fuel chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, jeopardizing childrens futures.\nAir pollutions toll goes far beyond childrens health  it strains already overwhelmed healthcare systems, drives up costs, and disrupts learning and productivity. School absences due to illness, hindered brain development, and the risk of school closures limit childrens potential, while parents caring for sick children lose income. The economic fallout is staggering: the World Bank estimated that in 2019, air pollution from PM2.5 caused premature deaths and illnesses that cost East Asia and the Pacific 9.3 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), equivalent to more than $2.5 trillion.\nUNICEF urges governments, businesses, the health sector, parents and educators to urgently address air pollutions impact on children for children in East Asia and the Pacific, more specifically:\nUNICEF is partnering with governments, businesses, health systems, and communities across East Asia and the Pacific to protect children from the devastating effects of air pollution. Key initiatives include:\nAddressing air pollution will lead to enormous improvements in childrens health, education, and well-being, with ripple effects across entire societies and economies\" Kunugi emphasized. \"The solutions exist, and our collective future depends on implementing them.\n#####\nNotes\nAir pollution data: The figures cited in this press release are derived from UNICEFs analysis of global air pollution and child health impacts data spanning 2000 to 2021. These findings are summarized in the advocacy brief,Growing Up in the Haze: Addressing Air Pollution and Its Impact on Children in East Asia and the PacificAn Agenda for Action.Key definitions:\nUNICEF, the United Nations agency for children, works to protect the rights of every child, everywhere, especially the most disadvantaged children and in the toughest places to reach. Across more than 190 countries and territories, we do whatever it takes to help children survive, thrive, and fulfil their potential.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333703/333703-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333703\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "The G7 group of industrialised nations has overshot self-imposed targets to reduce carbon emissions by 2025, instead subsidising climate-damaging fossil fuels by record amounts, a new report shows.[1]\nThe G7, which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US plus the EU, pledged in 2016 that it would reduce harmful fossil fuel subsidies by 2025  but tax subsidies for coal, oil and gas in these countries have increased by 15 percent since, to a total of 1.36 trillion US dollars in 2023, according to an analysis of International Monetary Fund (IMF) figures.[2]\nThe report, commissioned by Greenpeace Germany and carried out by the Forum for an Ecological and Social Market Economy (FöS) shows Italy as the worst offender, raising its subsidies by 166% in the period from 2016 to 2023. Germany was second, rising by 49%.\nGreenpeace International Climate & Energy Programme Lead Virag Kaufer said:\nThe G7 countries, some of the richest and most powerful nations on Earth, gave themselves almost a decade to take steps towards the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. Its now 2025  the year has started with devastating climate calamities  and they arent just missing that target; theyve increased the public spending on climate-wrecking fuels.With this year already bringing record fire damage in the USA, other climate-driven disasters, and the latest slew of multi-billion profits for fossil fuel corporations, governments need to get a grip on public spending and urgently divert it from fossil fuel incentives towards a just and sustainable transition.\nOf the seven nations, only Canada has slightly reduced its fossil fuel subsidies since 2016 (minus 11%). All other countries have increased their climate-damaging subsidies. According to the analysis based on IMF figures, the total amount spent on fossil fuel subsidies in 2023 was highest in the USA ($790 billion), followed by Japan ($269 billion) and Germany ($114 billion).\nThe rise in energy prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly increased subsidies for coal, oil and gas in most G7 countries. In Germany, measures such as gas and electricity price freezes, lower VAT rates on gas and far-reaching relief for industry accounted for 38% of the total fossil fuel subsidies in 2023 , according to the IMF. Some of these measures, originally announced as temporary, are still in place today.\nGreenpeace Germany energy expert Sophia van Vügt said:\nGermany can no longer afford to squander billions in tax revenue to subsidise company cars and air travel. We need these funds now to modernise the country in a socially just way for everyone.\nWith its fossil-based subsidy policy, the German government is creating false incentives that are harmful to the climate. The worlds third-largest economy would be better off relieving the burden on people with a socially staggered climate tax instead of financing climate-damaging behaviour with further energy subsidies.\nThe extremely climate-damaging expansion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants was not taken into account in the study due to a lack of data.\nEND\nNotes:1.

        "article text": "Simon & Schuster announced today that it will publish a new novel by award-winning and bestselling author John Irving, titledQUEEN ESTHER. Since the publication of his first novel in 1968, John Irving has written some of the most acclaimed books of our timeamong them,The World According to GarpandA Prayer for Owen Meany. Now, 40 years after the publication ofThe Cider House Rules, John Irving revisits the orphanage in St. Clouds, Mainethe setting of his bestselling novel and Academy Award-winning film. For readers or moviegoers familiar with the story, a beloved character reappears inQUEEN ESTHER. Dr. Wilbur Larch is younger than you remember him, and the unadopted orphans at St. Clouds are a different cast of charactersEsther Nacht, a Viennese-born Jew, among them. The story begins when Esther, not yet four, is abandoned one winter night. At age 14, she is taken in by a philanthropic New England family, becoming both a mystery and a guardian angel to them. The novel publishes on November 4, 2025.\nQUEEN ESTHERis Irvings 16th novel. Esther is born in Vienna in 1905. Anti-Semitism shapes her life, not only in Austria. Esthers story is fated to intersect with Israels history. In the final chapter, set in Jerusalem in 1981, Esther is 76. This story displays all the hallmarks of a great Irving novel; it has an emotional power that speaks to our times and challenges our thinking.\nThe novel always ended in Jerusalem in 1981. You cant revise or rewrite history. The construction of this novel long predates the events of Oct. 7, and everything thats happened in Israel since those terrorist attacks and the hostage-taking. With hindsight, its easy to say that what I saw and heard in Israel in the early 1980s serves as a precursor to what has developed since that time, but this is what historical fiction isfor,said John Irving.\nSaid his editor, Simon & Schuster President and Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Karp: One of the deepest pleasures of reading John Irving comes from discovering the turns in his story along with his characters, so I will give away no plot details, other than to say this: In QUEEN ESTHER, John Irving literally takes readers where hes never taken them before. The fact that John is still breaking new artistic ground in his 80s, and doing so with such audacious and impeccably crafted storytelling, is yet another reason why he is one of the worlds greatest writers.\nKarp acquired audio, first serial, United States and open market rights from Janet Turnbull, The Turnbull Agency.\nJohn Irvingwas born in Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1942. His first novel,Setting Free the Bears, was published in 1968, when he was 26. He competed as a wrestler for 20 years, and coached wrestling until he was 47. He is a member of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame in Stillwater, Oklahoma. In 1980, Mr. Irving won a National Book Award for his novelThe World According to Garp. In 2000, he won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay forThe Cider House Rules. In 2013, he won a Lambda Literary Award for his novelIn One Person. Internationally renowned, his novels have been translated into almost 40 languages. His all-time bestselling novel, in every language, isA Prayer for Owen Meany. A dual citizen of the United States and Canada, John Irving lives in Toronto.\nSimon & Schusteris a global leader in general interest publishing, dedicated to providing the best in fiction and nonfiction for readers of all ages, and in all printed, digital and audio formats. Its distinguished roster of authors includes many of the worlds most popular and widely recognized writers, and winners of the most prestigious literary honors and awards.

        "headline": "Vishwang Desai – The Top Challenges Faced by Data Centre Projects in India",
        "date": "2025-02-06",

        "link": "https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=333695",
        "article text": "Indias data centre industry is booming, but overcoming regulatory, power, and infrastructure challenges is key to unlocking its full potential.  Vishwang Desai\nIndias data centre industry is on an upward trajectory, with projections indicating a doubling of capacity from 0.9 GW in 2023 to approximately 2 GW by 2026. This growth is fueled by the countrys digital transformation, the rollout of 5G technology, and the increasing demand for cloud services and AI applications. However, this expansion is not without its hurdles. Here, we delve into the top challenges that data centre projects in India are currently facing:1. Regulatory and Compliance Issues:The regulatory landscape for data centres in India is complex and evolving. The proposed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, and other regulations like RBIs mandate for storing payment system data within India, have introduced stringent data localization requirements. These laws necessitate significant investments in local infrastructure, which can be both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive national policy framework leads to a patchwork of state-level incentives and regulations, creating a fragmented approach to compliance. This regulatory uncertainty can deter potential investors and complicate the operational landscape for data centre operators.2. Power Supply and Energy Costs:Data centres are power-intensive, and in India, the cost of power remains a significant challenge. The high energy consumption, coupled with the need for reliable power supply, places a substantial financial burden on operators. The industry is pushing towards sustainability, with some data centres adopting green energy sources like solar and wind power. However, the transition to renewable energy requires substantial upfront investment and infrastructure development, which can be prohibitive for many operators.3. Land Acquisition and Real Estate:Finding suitable locations for data centres is becoming increasingly difficult due to competition for space in major cities like Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad. The need for large plots of land with access to robust infrastructure, including power and connectivity, adds to the complexity. Land acquisition processes are often lengthy and fraught with bureaucratic hurdles, further delaying project timelines.4. Skilled Workforce Shortage:The rapid growth of the data centre industry has outpaced the availability of skilled personnel. From IT professionals to maintenance staff, there is a significant gap in the workforce capable of managing and operating these sophisticated facilities. This shortage not only affects operational efficiency but also increases costs due to the need for extensive training or hiring from abroad.5. Environmental Sustainability:With data centres contributing to a notable portion of global greenhouse gas emissions, there is increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices. The challenge lies in balancing the need for expansion with environmental responsibility. Innovations in cooling systems, energy-efficient technologies, and waste management are essential but require significant investment and a shift in operational philosophy.6. Security and Data Protection:Data security remains a paramount concern. While the physical security of data centres is crucial, the focus is also on cybersecurity, especially with the rise in cyber threats. Compliance with international standards like ISO 27001 and local laws like the Information Technology Act is mandatory, but the evolving nature of cyber threats means that security measures must be continuously updated and fortified.7. Infrastructure and Connectivity:Despite improvements, Indias infrastructure, particularly in terms of connectivity, still poses challenges. The rollout of 5G and the need for edge computing to reduce latency require a robust network infrastructure. However, the uneven distribution of high-speed internet and the concentration of submarine cable landing stations in a few cities like Mumbai and Chennai can limit the geographical expansion of data centres.8. Financial and Investment Challenges:The high capital expenditure required for setting up data centres, with costs per MW rising significantly, poses a financial challenge. While the government has granted infrastructure status to data centres, easing financing, the return on investment can be slow, deterring some investors. Moreover, the need for long-term capital commitments in an industry with rapidly changing technology and regulatory environments adds to the financial risk.9. Operational Efficiency and Scalability:Data centres must be scalable to meet the growing demand for data storage and processing. However, scaling operations efficiently while maintaining uptime, security, and cost-effectiveness is a complex task. The industrys shift towards edge computing to cater to tier II and III cities adds another layer of complexity in terms of operational management and infrastructure development.10. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:Ensuring data centres can withstand natural disasters or other disruptions is critical. This involves not just physical security but also robust data backup and disaster recovery strategies. The lack of comprehensive policies addressing these issues in the draft Data Centre Policy leaves operators to navigate these challenges independently, often at a high cost.In conclusion, while Indias data centre industry is poised for significant growth, the challenges it faces are multifaceted, requiring a collaborative approach from government, industry stakeholders, and investors. Addressing these issues through policy reforms, investment in sustainable technologies, workforce development, and infrastructure enhancement will be key to unlocking the full potential of Indias data centre market. The journey ahead is challenging but also filled with opportunities for those who can navigate this complex landscape effectively.For more articles and news by Vishwang Desai, click here:https://vishwangdesai.tumblr.com/\nWebWireID333695\nThis news content may be integrated into any legitimate news gathering and publishing effort.

        "article text": "Aaron Steiners visionary work,Myth: The Origin of Man,redefines the concept of myth by weaving an intricate and compelling narrative about humanitys beginnings. This thought-provoking book bridges ancient lore, science fiction, and philosophy to answer one of mankinds most profound questions: How did we come to be?Reflecting the true essence of mythology,Mythdelves into the enigmatic relationship between humanity and its extraterrestrial creators, the Anunaki. Originating from the star system Sirius B, the Anunaki arrive on ancient Earth in pursuit of gold and natural resources. Establishing an advanced outpost named Edin, they soon face a labor rebellion that forces them to genetically engineer a workforce. By blending their DNA with native primates, the first humanoid beings - the Lulu - are born.However, the limitations of the Lulu workforce lead the Anunaki to further experimentation, incorporating DNA from the star system Lyra. The result: the human race as we know it. Among these early creations, the first female, Lilith, embarks on a transformative journey of self-discovery, ultimately asserting her place among the Anunaki elite.Through vivid storytelling, Steiner paints an imaginative yet profoundly reflective narrative that challenges traditional views of human origins, addressing themes of empowerment, identity, and our connection to the cosmos.Discover More:Authors Website:https://MythTheOriginOfMan.comAuthors Promotional Video:https://youtu.be/S46vVNRsWKE?si=TlSrsf7HsVEJ2OePMYTH Storyboard Group Page:https://www.facebook.com/share/g/1Cu6iMnzM2/Myth: The Origin of Manis a must-read for those who love exploring ancient mysteries, the intersection of myth and science, and the deeper truths of human existence.Myth: The Origin of Manis available at Simply Best Reads (https://simplybestreads.com/product/my-the-origin-of-man/), Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Origin-Man-Aaron-Steiner/dp/161204865X/),https://MythTheOriginOfMan.comand other major online retailers and online bookstores.Myth: The Origin of ManWritten byAaron SteinerPublished by Strategic Book PublishingPublished date: June 22, 2012Paperback Price: $17.75About the AuthorAaron Steiner is an author/jeweler/artist/inventor that hails from the Pacific Northwest of the USA. He acquired a degree in Fine Art, and has extensively studied world religion, metaphysics, world mythology and the hidden agendas of the powers that be.Having developed his world view early in his adulthood by living in such places as Hawaii, and being drawn to certain ancient Mayan temples, he set out to createMythwhen it became very apparent to him that the Western culture he was from, was seriously devoid of any good human origin mythology. This in itself seemed to be true, simply because the people of the West are a very literal culture, so they would need a very literal account of their origins to adhere to.The story ofMythwas then introduced to provide this literal account, not only for Western culture, but for the rest of the world as well.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/73818/332451/332451-1.jpg)\nWebWireID332451\nThis news content may be integrated into any legitimate news gathering and publishing effort.

        "article text": "If you truly wish to know the future of mankind, then this guide offers a glimpse while staying faithfully within the bounds of Scripture.\nSince she was 14, Barbara C. Sturm has had a love for reading the Bible and was eager to start teaching it to the rest of the world. When she turned twenty, she eventually got her first chance, teaching the Bible to first-graders at Sunday school.Yet, while the Bible covered a wide variety of topics, the one she was most eager to explore was the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Her study began with just a few notes. Yet, in time, those notes multiplied and she realized that she may have very well written a book that could guide others in their study of Jesus glorious return.Her books title isMaranatha: Our Lord Will Come!,and she already arranged for a fresh round of promotional work for it in the coming year. These even include an exhibit at the Book Confab (L.A.), organized by the self-publishing and book marketing company ReadersMagnet, and theLos Angeles Times Festival of Books 2025.InMaranatha,Sturm strives to use her knowledge of Scripture to offer a more balanced view on events like the Rapture, Tribulation, and other topics related to the End Times. She hopes to offer something that emphasizes more positive perspectives as well as further emphasis on staying within the bounds of Scripture amidst all the speculation of whats to come.Maranathawill be displayed at the Book Confab (L.A.). ReadersMagnet will also display the book at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books 2025. The Festival will run from April 26-27, 2025, at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.Get a copy ofMaranatha: Our Lord Will Come!onAmazonandBarnes & Noble.Author Bio\nBarbara C. Sturm was born in a small fishing village called Southport, North Carolina. At the age of four, her dad became an engineer on a dredge boat. It was then that the family started traveling with him from Virginia, Georgia, and Florida, and then back to North Carolina. At the age of nine, they returned to Southport to live. She also grew up in church, and at the age of 14, she received Jesus as her Lord and Savior. It was at this time that the Lord gave her a passion for teaching the Bible, but she was too young at that time and needed more education in the Bible. Around that time, God also gave her a great love for the second coming of Jesus Christ.\nWhen she graduated from high school, she went to Alexandria, Virginia, to study computer programming at Virginia Computer College, where she met her husband, Donald Sturm. At the age of 20, they were married. They have now been married for 52 years.\nAfter she was married, she started teaching little first graders the Bible in Sunday school and first through sixth grade in childrens chapel. But she believed God was calling her to teach teenagers. So, she moved up to middle school and then senior high. But then, after senior high, the Lord wanted her to start teaching adult women.\nThrough the years, she studied the Bible with emphasis on the second coming of Jesus Christ. She kept writing notes and giving them to her teen girls. They eventually told her to write a book and stop giving them so many notes.\nAfter finishing computer school, she and her husband started working at the Census Bureau. She worked there for nine and a half years before having to retire on disability because she needed back surgery. She has scoliosis, which is a curvature of the spine, and she was going to have to be in a body cast for 12 months. It was then that the Lord told her to begin putting all her many notes into a book. That is whenMaranathawas born. In many ways, it was her lifes work. She started taking notes as a young teenager, and by the age of 27, the Lord told her to start writing a book. Now, at the age of 73, it has been a lifelong study.\nBOOK DETAILS:Maranatha: Our Lord Will Come!Author: Barbara C.

The beacons then provide the activation coordinates to the network, allowing first responders to rescue lost or distressed explorers.\nThe Search and Rescue Office, part of NASAs SCaN (https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/index.html) Program, has assisted in search and rescue services since its formation in 1979 Now, the office is building on their long legacy of Earth-based beacon development to support crewed missions to space.\nThe beacons also are used for emergency location, if needed, as part of NASAs crew launches to and from the International Space Station, and will support NASAs Artemis campaign crew recovery preparations during future missions returning from deep space. Systems being tested, like theANGEL(Advanced Next-Generation Emergency Locator) beacon, are benefitting life on Earth and missions to the Moon and Mars. Most recently, NASA partnered with the Department of Defense to practice Artemis II recovery procedures  including ANGEL beacon activation  duringURT-11(Underway Recovery Test 11).\nThe SCaN program at NASAHeadquartersin Washington provides strategic oversight to the Search and Rescue office.NOAA manages the U.S. network region for Cospas-Sarsat, which relies on flight and ground technologies originally developed at NASAshttps://www.nasa.gov/goddardin Greenbelt, Maryland.U.S. region rescue efforts are led by the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Air Force, and many other local rescue authorities.\nBy: Kendall Murphy\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/333689/333689-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333689\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Singapores reputation as a global hub for excellence in healthcare continues to grow, with eight of its academic medical centres (AMC) being featured in Brand Finances Global Top 250 Hospitals 2025 rankings, according to a new report from Brand Finance, the worlds leading brand valuation consultancy.\nSix of these academic medical centres, namely theNational University Health System, Singapore General Hospital, Mount Elizabeth Hospital - Orchard, Gleneagles Hospital, Mount Alvernia HospitalandTan Tock Seng Hospitalrank among the top 100 globally.\nSingapores leading healthcare institutions earned high scores across critical market research metrics such asconsideration for patient care,attracting top medical research talent,andbrand momentum. They were also highly recommended by healthcare professionals forpatient careandmedical training\nMount Elizabeth Hospital - Orchardhas been ranked as the worlds second-strongest AMC hospital for patient care. The hospital is recognised in the study forusing and applying artificial intelligence, ensuring patients benefit from the latest developments in healthcare. Its reputation for exceptional patient treatment is further strengthened by its adoption of cutting-edge medical technologies, including the integration of artificial intelligence to enhance diagnostics, treatment precision, and overall patient outcomes.\nAlex Haigh, Managing Director Asia Pacific, Brand Finance,commented:\n[i\"Singapores Academic Medical Centres have gained recognition for their excellence in patient care and ability to attract medical talent.[/i]Our research for 2025 highlights the value of maintaining a well-rounded focus on care, research, and training to reinforce global leadership, in the midst of a highly competitive sector vying for top talents, patients, and research partnerships.\nThese achievements also reveal valuable opportunities for continued progress and refinement. Singaporean hospitals scored comparatively lower inconsideration for researchandconsideration for teachingmetrics, suggesting that while they excel in patient-focused care, there is room to further strengthen their reputation in academic and research endeavours.\nSingapores top 100 AMC institutions featured in this years report are as follows:\nFor the first time the study also highlights what makes a hospital attractive for employment and what drives healthcare professionals to recommend a hospital for patient care, research, or education.\nWhen considering employment at hospitals:\nWhen recommending hospitals:\nBrand Financeis the worlds leading brand valuation consultancy. Bridging the gap between marketing and finance, Brand Finance evaluates the strength of brands and quantifies their financial value to help organisations make strategic decisions.\nHeadquartered in London, Brand Finance operates in over 25 countries. Every year, Brand Finance conducts more than 6,000 brand valuations, supported by original market research, and publishes over 100 reports which rank brands across all sectors and countries.\nBrand Finance also operates the Global Brand Equity Monitor, conducting original market research annually on 6,000 brands, surveying more than 175,000 respondents across 41 countries and 31 industry sectors. By combining perceptual data from the Global Brand Equity Monitor with data from its valuation database  the largest brand value database in the world  Brand Finance equips ambitious brand leaders with the data, analytics, and the strategic guidance they need to enhance brand and business value.\nIn addition to calculating brand value, Brand Finance also determines the relative strength of brands through a balanced scorecard of metrics evaluating marketing investment, stakeholder equity, and business performance, compliant with ISO 20671.\nBrand Finance is a regulated accountancy firm and a committed leader in the standardisation of the brand valuation industry. Brand Finance was the first to be certified by independent auditors as compliant with both ISO 10668 and ISO 20671 and has received the official endorsement of the Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) in the United States.\nBrand is defined as a marketing-related intangible asset including, but not limited to, names, terms, signs, symbols, logos, and designs, intended to identify goods, services, or entities, creating distinctive images and associations in the minds of stakeholders, thereby generating economic benefits.\nBrand strength is the efficacy of a brands performance on intangible measures relative to its competitors. Brand Finance evaluates brand strength in a process compliant with ISO 20671, looking at Marketing Investment, Stakeholder Equity, and the impact of those on Business Performance. The data used is derived from Brand Finances proprietary market research programme and from publicly available sources.\nEach brand is assigned a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score out of 100, which feeds into the brand value calculation. Based on the score, each brand is assigned a corresponding Brand Rating up to AAA+ in a format similar to a credit rating.\nBrand Finance calculates the values of brands in its rankings using the Royalty Relief approach  a brand valuation method compliant with the industry standards set in ISO 10668. It involves estimating the likely future revenues that are attributable to a brand by calculating a royalty rate that would be charged for its use, to arrive at a brand value understood as a net economic benefit that a brand owner would achieve by licensing the brand in the open market.\nThe steps in this process are as follows:\n1 Calculate brand strength using a balanced scorecard of metrics assessing Marketing Investment, Stakeholder Equity, and Business Performance. Brand strength is expressed as a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score on a scale of 0 to 100.\n2 Determine royalty range for each industry, reflecting the importance of brand to purchasing decisions. In luxury, the maximum percentage is high, while in extractive industry, where goods are often commoditised, it is lower. This is done by reviewing comparable licensing agreements sourced from Brand Finances extensive database.\n3 Calculate royalty rate. The BSI score is applied to the royalty range to arrive at a royalty rate. For example, if the royalty range in a sector is 0-5% and a brand has a BSI score of 80 out of 100, then an appropriate royalty rate for the use of this brand in the given sector will be 4%.\n4 Determine brand-specific revenues by estimating a proportion of parent company revenues attributable to a brand.\n5 Determine forecast revenues using a function of historic revenues, equity analyst forecasts, and economic growth rates.\n6 Apply the royalty rate to the forecast revenues to derive brand revenues.\n7 Discount post-tax brand revenues to a net present value which equals the brand value.\nBrand Finance has produced this study with an independent and unbiased analysis. The values derived and opinions presented in this study are based on publicly available information and certain assumptions that Brand Finance used where such data was deficient or unclear. Brand Finance accepts no responsibility and will not be liable in the event that the publicly available information relied upon is subsequently found to be inaccurate. The opinions and financial analysis expressed in the study are not to be construed as providing investment or business advice. Brand Finance does not intend the study to be relied upon for any reason and excludes all liability to any body, government, or organisation.\nThe data presented in this study form part of Brand Finances proprietary database, are provided for the benefit of the media, and are not to be used in part or in full for any commercial or technical purpose without written permission from Brand Finance.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/333687/333687-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333687\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Combined values for Opel Grandland Plug-in Hybrid according to WLTP1: weighted energy consumption 21.9-23.4 kWh electricity/100 km plus 0.8-0.9 l petrol/100 km; CO2emissions 19-21 g/km; CO2class B. With discharged battery: fuel consumption 6.8-7.0 l/100 km; CO2class F.\nThenew Opel Grandlandimpresses with its attractive styling, groundbreaking technologies, clever solutions, lots of space and completely electrified range of drivetrains. TheGolden Steering Wheel 20242winner is available as the fully electric Grandland Electric, the Grandland Hybrid with 48-volt technology and the powerful Grandland Plug-in Hybrid. The team around Grandland chief engineer Dirk Kaminski has now put the clever plug-in hybrid drive concept to the test  with astonishing results that will impress company car and long-distance drivers.\nThe WLTP values3are clear: According to the official test cycle, our new Grandland Plug-in Hybrid offers a combined range of up to 897 kilometres, of which up to 87 kilometres are purely electric, said Dirk Kaminski. But we thought to ourselves: Lets see what the car can really do. Our new top-of-the-range SUV will definitely break the 1,000-kilometre mark with a full tank and a full charge. After all, the Grandland is made in Germany through and through and rolls off the assembly line in the ultra-modern Eisenach factory. So we put it to the test  under conditions that are worse than in the official test cycle.\nFrom full to empty: 1,115 kilometres covered under adverse conditions\nWhile the WLTP values are determined at temperatures of around 23 degrees Celsius, the new Grandland Plug-in Hybrid set off on a windy and rainy January morning at a fresh 11 degrees Celsius. And  appropriate for the season  on 19-inch winter tyres instead of summer tyres with lower rolling resistance and in the fully-equipped GS trim. The only requirement was: The SUV has a full tank and the 17.9 kWh battery is fully charged. Now we drive until the fuel tank and battery are empty.\nThe plug-in hybrid completed typical commuter routes from the Rhine-Main area around Rüsselsheim and Frankfurt to the Rhine-Neckar area and back again. The routes included motorway stretches with free-flowing traffic, with stop-and-go traffic and rush-hour traffic, as well as country roads and city traffic including traffic light stops  a real-life test that reflects the true everyday requirements of many company car drivers.\nThe result or the distance that the Grandland Plug-in Hybrid, which delivers 143 kW (195 hp) system output and 350 Newton meters of maximum torque, achieved with just one tank filling and battery charge, exceeded the expectations of the Opel team: at an average speed of 80 km/h and a highly efficient overall average consumption of 4.6 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres, the SUV covered a total of 1,115 kilometres in four stages (interrupted by breaks to meet the legal requirements to adhere to driving times). Of this, the plug-in hybrid drove a little more than a third of the total distance, or more precisely 380 kilometres, purely battery-electric and therefore locally emissions-free.\nThe fact that the Grandland achieves such outstanding values under these circumstances  at the end of the test temperatures had dropped to just 4 degrees Celsius  has once again confirmed that we have created a car that is groundbreaking in every respect with a drive concept that is completely suitable for everyday use. The highly efficient combustion engine and the electric motor work in perfect harmony, said Kaminski. More than that: every time you decelerate, the powertrain switches to electric operation. This is possible because the recuperated energy is used to power the car electrically meaning that long distances can be covered at low and medium speeds with no local emissions.\nGreenovation à la Opel: resource-saving SUV and drive concept\nThe new Opel Grandland Plug-in Hybrid therefore shines as the ideal choice for fully electric commuter routes as well as for long-distance company car and leisure drivers who want to be particularly resource-efficient and leave range anxiety behind. Not only the use of recycled materials and the absence of chrome show what Opel means by Greenovation and sustainability in the new top-of-the-line SUV. This is also impressively demonstrated by the results of the test.\nNumerous other qualities of the completely new Grandland make daily business trips as well as long journeys even more pleasant: the ergonomic seats certified by Aktion Gesunder Rücken e.V. (AGR) ensure relaxed driving pleasure. The patented Intelli-Seat ergonomic feature is standard on all front seats. And with technologies such as the glare-free Intelli-Lux HD light, the Intelli-HUD head-up display or the illuminated, translucent Pixel Box, Grandland drivers are perfectly equipped.\nAt the end of the test, one final question remains: What distance would the new Grandland Plug-in Hybrid be able to cover with a full tank and full battery under ideal test conditions \nfor example, in early summer? The insights that we as a team have gained from the 1,115 kilometres we have now driven is: Under optimal conditions, even more would certainly be possible, said Kaminski.\nThe new Opel Grandland Plug-in Hybrid with 143 kW (195 hp) system output, 350 Nm of maximum torque and a top speed of 220 km/h can be ordered from prices starting at 40,150 (RRP including VAT in Germany).\n[1]A vehicles values not only depend on the vehicles efficient use of fuel, but are also influenced by driving behaviour and other non-technical factors.\n[2]AUTO BILD edition 46/2024 and BILD am SONNTAG edition 45/2024, category Best car under 50,000.\n[3]Range determined according to WLTP test procedure methodology (R (EC) No. 715/2007, R (EU) No. 2017/1151). The actual range can vary under everyday conditions and depends on various factors, in particular on personal driving style, route characteristics, outside temperature, use of heating and air conditioning and thermal preconditioning.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/333686/333686-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333686\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

The same three drivers were working with the Pirelli engineers today on development of the 2026 tyres, with Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton sharing a Ferrari SF-24, while Oscar Piastri was at the wheel of a McLaren MCL60. Both cars had been adapted to suit the prototype tyres designed around the new technical regulations that will come into force next year, being narrower than the current ones by 25 millimetres at the front and 30 at the rear.\nA total of 300 laps was completed today, 74 by the Monegasque driver, 74 for his British team-mate and 152 for the Australian. Here are the fastest recorded lap times, although they have no real significance given the different work programmes carried out for Pirelli by the two teams: 114971 for Leclerc, 116759 for Hamilton and 115815 for Piastri.\nIt was a very useful session, particularly when it came to providing a comparison between the various different constructions for next season, as well as experimenting with some compounds from the harder end of the range,commented Pirelli Motorsport Director, Mario Isola.The Barcelona circuit is known as one of the most demanding for the tyres in terms of the energy exerted and degradation, therefore the information we have gathered over these two busy days will be very important for the future development of this generation of tyres. Its a really demanding start to the year with four test sessions even before the season begins and I want to thank all the teams that are working with us, because we know how busy they are at the moment.\nFollowing on from last weeks test in Paul Ricard and this one in Barcelona, the team of Pirelli engineers are heading further south next week, for two days of testing at the Jerez de la Frontera circuit, in Andalusia on 13 and 14 February. Alpine will be taking part on both days, while McLaren and Mercedes will do one day each. The final pre-season test will take place at Bahrains Sakhir circuit on 2 and 3 March with Alpine and Williams running both days.

The heart of the Lancia passion within the service parks will be the \"Villaggio Lancia Corse HF\", the true pulsating hub of each Trofeo rally.\nThe 2025 season will follow the CIAR dates starting on May 9th with the Rally Targa Florio, followed fifteen days later by the Rally Due Valli. In July, the Rally di Roma Capitale, also valid for the European Championship, will be a key event. The Roman appointment will be divided into two races for the Trophy, allowing teams and drivers to optimize travel costs and aim for double prize money: the first leg will count as Round 3, while the second as Round 4. After the summer break, the Trofeo Lancia will feature the Rally del Lazio before culminating in the legendary Rallye di Sanremo.\nBefore the official start of the Trofeo, Lancia Corse HF will be present at the Rally Regione Piemonte with its full facilities and hospitality, highlighting the strong legacy between Lancia and the Piedmont region.

        "article text": "ACD/Labs, an informatics company that develops and commercializes software in support of digitalized R&D, today released its 2025 Structure Elucidation & Verification Report. Distilled from the experience and expertise of hundreds of researchers gathered at the ACD/Labs annual virtual symposium in Q4 2024, the report discusses how trends have shifted since 2022; and how some of the worlds leading R&D organizations are setting themselves up for success in 2025 and beyond.The symposia have featured presentations from Novartis, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), Medtronic, Sanofi, Novartis, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Corteva Agriscience, Sutro Biopharma, and Shimadzu; discussing challenges, goals, and how ACD/Labs Spectrus® technologies are helping drive productivity and efficiency.As analytical groups are trying to support an increasing volume of requests without expanded capacity or staffing, the report highlights an upward trend in sample handling automation, automated data processing, and prediction (AI/ML-based) model development. Furthermore, stakeholders report that productivity initiatives must ensure expected levels of data integrity, quality, and result accuracy.Workflow automation and high throughput analysis are being implemented across R&D sectors to address the increasing volume and complexity of analytical samples. Hyphenated chromatography techniques (LC/MS, LC/UV/MS, etc.) remain the top priority for automation with more than 70% selecting this to be the type of data they automate or would choose to. Interest in automating NMR, MS, and optical data analyses has increased in the last few years. Finally, while 60% still carry out manual structure verification, automated structure verification by NMR (ASV) is reported to be an efficiency driver for both NMR experts and synthetic/medicinal chemists in open-access labs.Improving data quality and accuracy remains a focus, not only to provide efficiency benefits from automated workflows without significantly increasing risk, but also so that data can be confidently used in machine learning and AI-powered structure elucidation.The multi-technique approach employed by most labs for structure characterization is also discussed. Software supporting entire workflows or the ability to assemble data in one interface is reported to eliminate the risk of data transcription errors, increase confidence, and empower analysts.We spend the majority of our time on structure elucidation and verification, but no other conference or meeting makes this their focus, said an attendee and past speaker who is responsible for materials characterization at a leading pharmaceutical company. Its exhilarating to share challenges and successes with peers across the industry and leave with ideas of how we can further improve efficiency and confidence in our work.Read the full report atwww.acdlabs.com/SEV2025Report.About ACD/LabsACD/Labs is a leading provider of scientific software, aiding decision-making and digital transformation in chemical and pharmaceutical R&D.Our science-centric solutions offer harmonized, AI-ready analytical, structural, and molecular information, with FAIR-compliance.

        "article text": "The Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto (MOCA) unveils its Spring 2025 season on April 17 with a dynamic combination of exhibitions and projects by Jessica Stockholder, Sondra Perry, Justin Ming Yong, and Margaux Williamson. This season highlights thought-provoking works and new commissions that traverse painting, sculpture, installation, moving image, animation, digital technology, textile, and sound. Rooted in complex explorations of material and form, each presentation invites us to reflect on the mysteries of the spaces we inhabit and the quiet significance of the objects that describe our lives. Rich with diverse forms of expression, each project confronts the unease of the present, drawing from colour, material, shape, movement, sound, and light as potent sources of energy and understanding.\nJessica StockholderThe Squared Circle: RingingApril 17August 3, 2025Floor 1, Price Family Community Galleryand the Lindy Green Forum\nJessica Stockholder presentsThe Squared Circle: Ringing,her first major commission in Canada in twenty-five years.This site-specific, all-encompassing work reimagines Floor 1 as an environment that embraces friction and play alongside a series of text-based interventions. Celebrated for her paintings in space, Stockholder has held a pivotal role in expanding the dialogue between painting and sculpture, blending colours with architecture and unassuming everyday objects in sensational ways.\nHer works resist quick observation; their depth and scale invite gradual exploration and continuously reveal new elements. Executed with a balance of planning and on-site intuition, Stockholder enters into various thinking processes, embracing unpredictability. As a result, her work exists at the intersection of abstract expressionism, colour field painting, minimalism, and theatre.\nSondra PerryApril 17August 3, 2025Digital Futures ResidencyFloor 1, North End Gallery\nJustin Ming YongBlurApril 17August 3, 2025Floor 1, MOCA Elevators\nMOCA will expand its offerings this season withBlur, a new site-specific project by textile artist Justin Ming Yong, whose handmade quilts will transform the museums elevators into art spaces.\nIn recent years, Yong has developed a textile practice that reinterprets traditional quilt-makinga craft passed down to him by his mother. This practice, rooted in centuries-old cultural traditions, explores the interplay of colour, pattern, texture, and geometry.\nMargaux WilliamsonShoes, books, hands, buildings, and carsApril 17August 3, 2025Floor 3\nMargaux Williamsons cinematic compositions, which bridge elements of still-life and surrealism, will hold Floor 3 of the museum. Williamsons paintings draw from the intimate views and objects of her surroundings, as well as a personal archive of gathered materials. Though familiar, these source materials are reimagined, and drift freely across her canvases. Her muted colour palette and ethereal brushwork, combined with contrasting perspectives, evoke the sensation of memories and dreams.\nThis exhibition includes a selection of recent and newly commissioned paintings that reflect the tones and architecture of the museum while centering her subtle yet evocative use of shadow and light.Shoes, books, hands, buildings, and carshighlights the evolution of Williamsons painting practice, which has grown in both complexity and scale. While rooted in figuration, her style embraces an abstract, gestural quality that invites multiple interpretations, creating a sense of both intimacy and distance.\nAlex Da CorteEar WormJanuary 26, 2024August 3, 2025Floor 2, Karen Green Gallery\nDue to overwhelming demand, Alex Da Cortes acclaimed exhibitionEar Wormwill remain open on MOCAs Floor 2 throughout the spring season, offering visitors another chance to explore what has been described as a surreal tender bewildering experience.\nWere incredibly excited about the year ahead as MOCA continues to build on the momentum of our rigorous programmes in recent years, said Kathleen Bartels, Executive Director and CEO. The Spring 2025 exhibitions involve collaborations with artists on new commissions while highlighting key thematic connections across the museum. The thoughtfully curated and unique exhibitions will deepen our engagement with visitors and enhance our public and learning initiatives.\nSpring 2025 ProgrammingMOCAs spring exhibition season will feature a dynamic lineup of public programmes that includes artist talks, workshops, and live performances.

        "article text": "Following copyright and other intellectual property rules is essential when you distribute music. But we know these rules can be complicated and even intimidating for independent artists. So, here are some simple copyright-related tips for making your distribution experience as smooth as possible:\nTip #1: Dont use someone elses work without permission.\nCopyright gives the creator or owner of an original work of authorship the exclusive right to copyright, distribute, publicly display or perform the work, or to make derivative works (such as remixes).\nTL; DR:If you didnt create an artistic work, you shouldnt use it (even just a TINY BIT) without permission from whoever created or owns it. This is especially true for anything you plan to distribute to music services, a commercial use that can generate royalties.\nHere are some common examples of work you shouldnt include in your release without permission:\nSamples\nInstrumentals\nVocals of other artists\nFilm, TV or videogame clips\nSnippets from Instagram or TikTok posts\nPhotographs or drawings on your cover artwork\nEven if youve modified the work - such as speeding it up, slowing it down, filtering it or adding to it - you still need permission. Submitting music you dont have permission to distribute can lead to your releases being rejected and your account restricted or terminated. It can also lead to a lawsuit.\nDont do it.\nTip #2: Be careful with third-party beats, even if theyre free or royalty-free.\nThe Internet is filled with producers and companies offering independent artists free beats or royalty-free music that can be licensed for a small fee. Unfortunately, it usually isnt that simple:\nFree beats are typically restricted to non-commercial use, meaning you cant use them in the music you distribute.\nRoyalty-free music offered by companies likeEpidemic Soundcan typically only be used in the background of videos uploaded to UGC platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube\nAnd beats you find online might include someone elses work that the producer hasnt gotten permission for (see Tip #1). Even if you purchased a beat, the license agreement might say that you, not the producer, are responsible for clearing any samples.\nSo, before you use someone elses beat in music you plan to distribute, make sure that you carefully:\nListen for potential samples or other third-party material\nReview the video description, terms of service, or license agreement to understand any restrictions\nReach out to the producer or company making the beat available if youre unsure about anything\nTip #3: Give your contributors credit.\nIf someone else has contributed to your music - whether as an artist, producer, or songwriter - make sure you give them proper credit when submitting your release. This isnt just a matter of pride. Music services use credits to ensure that publishing royalties are paid correctly, and producers may use credits to verify that an artist has purchased their beat. So, failure to do this correctly can result in copyright claims or worse.\nIf you have purchased a beat or feature, you might also have an obligation to pay master royalties to the producer or featured artist, which you can set up using ourSplit Payfeature.\nWe hope these tips are helpful as you take the exciting step of distributing your music as an independent artist!\nFor more detailed information about copyright and related topics, please see theLegal sectionof our help center. And, as always, we are here to help. If you have questions about these tips, please submit a support request usingour formor by emailingsupport@unitedmasters.com.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/333661/333661-1.png)\nWebWireID333661\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Over the next three years, Steve McQueens film installationGrenfellwill be shown in public art galleries in six major cities across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It will open at Tramway in Glasgow this spring, after which it will travel to Chapter in Cardiff, The MAC in Belfast, The Box in Plymouth, Tate Liverpool, and Midland Arts Centre in Birmingham.\nIn December 2017, artist and filmmaker Steve McQueen (b.1969, London) made an artwork in response to the fire that took place earlier that year on 14 June at Grenfell Tower. 72 people died in the tragedy. Filming the tower before it was covered with hoarding, McQueen sought to create a record so that it would not be forgotten.\nFollowing the fire, a Government Inquiry was launched that was conducted in two phases. The findings of the first and second phase of the Inquiry have been reported, the recommendations of which are yet to be implemented, meaning a similar tragedy could happen again. There is an ongoing criminal investigation.\nSteve McQueen said I knew once the tower was covered up, it would start to leave peoples minds. I was determined that it never be forgotten.\nGrenfellwas first presented in 2023 at Serpentine in Londons Kensington Gardens, following a period of private viewings, prioritising bereaved families and survivors. The work was then placed in the care of Tate and London Museum.\nThis national tour is being coordinated by Tate in collaboration with the partner venues and is made possible thanks to support using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England and from Art Fund. Each presentation will be free to visit and will be accompanied by a public engagement programme of talks, workshops and community events supported by the Grenfell Foundation.\nListing Information\nTramway, Glasgow, in partnership with The Common Guild8  23 March 2025\nChapter, Cardiff10 May  15 June 2025\nThe MAC, Belfast17 July  21 September 2025\nThe Box, PlymouthIn 2026.

This includes views inside the building and contractors at work. Some visitors may find the imagery upsetting. Each venue will help any visitors who need an opportunity to pause, rest and reflect after viewing the work.\nImages\nTo download press images, please visitthis Dropbox folder.

Please use this still to accompany articles on Steve McQueens workGrenfell. Please refrain from using other stock images of the tower, especially those on the night of the disaster and of the uncovered tower to be respectful to the Grenfell community as these images can be distressing.\nSteve McQueen\nSteve McQueen has been in conversation with Grenfell bereaved and survivor groups and individuals from the wider community at different times over the last seven years. He has engaged in these discussions so thatGrenfellis delivered sensitively and with the consideration of the bereaved and survivors at the forefront. The production of the work was self-funded by McQueen, it is not a commercial project and will not be sold.\nSteve McQueen was born in West London in 1969 and studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College where he first became interested in film. Over more than 30 years, McQueen has been influential in expanding the way in which artists work with film. He has made several feature films with many accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Film for 12 Years a Slave. His most recent film, Blitz, was released in 2024.

Hotrum, a drug abuse rehabilitation researcher who came to his field via a peculiar project that investigated drug abuse during WWII. He shares his journey, as well as his remarkable discoveries about the war, in a book titledHitler, The Third Reich, and Methamphetamines: Drug Abuse and Politics.The book originated as a thesis when Hotrum was earning his bachelors degree in political science from the University of California. It focused on the possibility of rational actors during times of conflict no longer being rational due to the widespread yet societally tolerated abuse of mind-altering drugs.Hitler, The Third Reich, and Methamphetaminesbuilds upon the relatively recent revelations regarding the use of opioids, narcotics, and other dangerous substances by Nazi forces, including Adolf Hitler himself. Using all the latest, declassified information from the Nazi regime, Hotrums book uses the Third Reich as a cautionary model of drug abuse by government actors and the manipulation of moneyed interests.So for WWII history buffs at the2025 London Book Fair, the book is a fascinating deep-dive into a relatively new perspective on the topic.

It was easy to say that the presence of churches and godly people is necessary, but he also realized that a growing number do not share that view.Eager to share his thoughts and help his fellow religious leaders, he published a book that challenged Christian readers to really think deeply about the consequences of a completely non-Christian world.The title of his book isIf You Build The People The People Will Build The Church.In it, he posits the serious consequences of a church-less world. He compares it to the darkness and chaos prior to when God declared: Let there be light.If You Build The People The People Will Build The Churchis a book that emphasizes the crucial role that church people play in being a light against that darkness.

        "article text": "Smoke residues deposited by the wind onto school grounds can sometimes include regulated hazardous materials like asbestos fibers and lead-contaminated dust.\nAfter a wildland-urban interface fire (also known as a wildfire or bushfire), the safety and well-being of students must remain a top priority, particularly when it comes to outdoor spaces like playgrounds and outdoor eating areas. It is common to encourage children to go outside and get some fresh air, but outside air can be anything but fresh during and for some time after such fires.While the immediate danger of burning may have passed, the outdoor environment can still pose significant risks. Lingering airborne particulates and settled debris can impact both indoor and outdoor spaces, where children may be exposed. Some of these fire residues are regulated hazardous materials, while others are nuisance dusts. These can act as asthma triggers for vulnerable staff, and some may have lasting neurological effects on students. Here are several key considerations to ensure the safety of students in these outdoor areas:\nSmoke residues deposited by the wind onto school grounds can sometimes include regulated hazardous materials like asbestos fibers and lead-contaminated dust, said Derrick A. Denis, Senior Vice President for Clark Seif Clark. These same substances can infiltrate a school or building through air pathways or foot traffic. Residues left behind from these fire events can cause concerns for extended durations, as these particulates tend to persist until they are removed by cleaning.Clark Seif Clark, Inc. (CSC) specializes in smoke impact testing and can provide hazardous material testing for schools. Assessing both outdoor and indoor environments is an important step in recovery, helping to ensure that students can focus on their education. Even if school buildings were not directly damaged by fire, they may still be impacted by smoke and other materials that have settled on surfaces students come into contact with during the school day.For more information on smoke residues, indoor air quality issues, and to schedule testing, schools can contact Clark Seif Clark, Inc.

        "article text": "The old saying Practice makes perfect! applies to the Moon too. On Tuesday, NASA gave 17 technologies, instruments, and experiments the chance to practice being on the Moon without actually going there. Instead, it was aflight testaboard a vehicle adapted to simulate lunar gravity for approximately two minutes.\nThe test began on February 4, 2025, with the 10:00 a.m. CST launch of Blue Origins New Shepard reusable suborbital rocket system in West Texas. With support from NASAsFlight Opportunitiesprogram, the company, headquartered in Kent, Washington, enhanced the flight capabilities of its New Shepard capsule to replicate the Moons gravity  which is about one-sixth of Earths  during suborbital flight.\nCommercial companies are critical to helping NASA prepare for missions to the Moon and beyond, said Danielle McCulloch, program executive of the agencys Flight Opportunities program. The more similar a test environment is to a missions operating environment, the better. So, we provided substantial support to this flight test to expand the available vehicle capabilities, helping ensure technologies are ready for lunar exploration.\nNASAs Flight Opportunities program not only secured seats for the technologies aboard this flight  for 16 payloads inside the capsule plus one mounted externally  but alsocontributed to New Shepards upgradesto provide the environment needed to advance their readiness for the Moon and other space exploration missions.\nAn extended period of simulated lunar gravity is an important test regime for NASA, said Greg Peters, program manager for Flight Opportunities. Its crucial to reducing risk for innovations that might one day go to the lunar surface.\nOne example is the LUCI (Lunar-g Combustion Investigation) payload, which seeks to understand material flammability on the Moon compared to Earth. This is an important component of astronaut safety in habitats on the Moon and could inform the design of potential combustion devices there. With support from theMoon to Mars Program Officewithin the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, researchers at NASAs Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, together with Voyager Technologies, designed LUCI to measure flame propagation directly during the Blue Origin flight.\nThe rest of the NASA-supported payloads on this Blue Origin flight included seven from NASAsGame Changing Developmentprogram that seek to mitigate the impact oflunar dustand to perform construction and excavation on the lunar surface. Three other NASA payloads tested instruments to detect subsurface water on the Moon as well as to study flow physics and phase changes in lunar gravity. Rounding out the manifest were payloads from Draper, Honeybee Robotics, Purdue University, and the University of California in Santa Barbara.\nFlight Opportunities is part of the agencys Space Technology Mission Directorate and is managed at NASAs Armstrong Flight Research Center.\nBy Nancy Pekar, NASAs Flight Opportunities program\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/333637/333637-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333637\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Busch Light returns to the biggest day in sports this year with not onlyone, but two new spots that will deliver trail-tested know-how and a good laugh for fans, with one spot that puts a playful spin on going in circles featuring NASCAR Cup Series driver Ross Chastain.\nAs the official beer sponsor of NASCAR, Busch Light knows a little something about going in circles. But when it comes to the outdoors, circling through the woods is a surefire way to get yourselflost.Thespot titled, Circles, opens with two bewildered backpackers making laps on their hike, when Busch Guy steps in with a tip to avoid going in circles by noting recognizable landmarks-like Chastains iconic No. 1 car. Chastain then pops out of his tent wondering aloud whats so bad about going in circles, promptingBusch Guy to clarify exactly what circles hes referring to.\nAs one of the most popular rising stars in NASCAR, Chastain has helped us ignite a new chapter in ourNASCAR legacy. And with the official NASCAR Cup Series season kicking off with the Daytona 500 just one week after the big game, we knew he was the perfect star to spotlight alongside Busch Guy in one of our spots this year, said Krystyn Stowe, Head of Marketing Busch Family & Natural Family at Anheuser-Busch.Busch Light has experienced upward growth for five years because we invest in meeting fans where they already are with a Busch Light in hand-whether theyre rooting for Ross in a NASCAR race, enjoying the great outdoors, or watching the big game.\nSince 2024, the brand has served as the primary sponsor of Ross Chastain, partnering with TrackhouseRacing to bring 21+ fans along for the ride of their lives and offer unparalleled access to the sport. Looking ahead to the 2025 season, Busch Light will continue its tradition of creating exciting paint schemesfrom the For the Farmers design to flavor innovations and morethat showcase what fans love most while they enjoy their favorite sport and their favorite beer.\nI used to daydream about seeing my race schedule hung up at my local bar in Busch Lights famous blues andwhites.NowIm not only on those walls, but in a commercial that will air in my hometown during the big game and across the nation this NASCAR season, starting with the Daytona 500\"said Chastain. Ive manifested this moment my entire life, and I cant thank Busch Light enough for supporting my racing career through their massive platform. Its a dream come true-and so was cracking open a cold Busch Light with the iconic Busch Guy after a long, fun day filming in the woods.\nIn the spot titled, Time, the Busch Guy provides another lesson in the series of cold and smooth survival skills by teaching fans how to tell time when in the great outdoors by using a Busch Light can to tell when its time for happy hour.\nBoth spots are a continuation of The Busch Guide, a series of lighthearted ads that star the brands rugged fan-favorite mascot, the Busch Guy. The new ads follow the brands reprisal of its classic 1979 jingle, Head for the Mountains, with Grammy award-winning saxophone legend Kenny G from its 2022 spot, and partnership with famed singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan to help fans find shelter in its 2023 spot. Additional ads featuring various survival skills and lessons from the Busch Guys full Busch Guidewill air throughout 2025.\nSee the full spotshereandhere.\nFans in select markets can catch the new spots on game day before they air nationally throughout the2025 NASCAR Cup Series season, starting with the Daytona 500.

Trackhouse Racing took to the track in 2021with driver Daniel Suárez and began a partnership with international superstar entertainer Pitbull who has elevated Trackhouses presence through inclusion in songs, music videos and named his 2023 album Trackhouse.\nMidway through the 2021 season, the organization purchased the NASCAR assets of Chip Ganassi Racingand began the 2022 season as a two-car team operating out of its Concord, North Carolina race shop with Suárez and Ross Chastain as drivers. Chastain gave the organization its first victory at Circuit of theAmericas in Austin, Texas in March, while Suárez became the first Mexican driver to win a Cup race whenhe won at Sonoma (Calif.) Raceway in June. In July 2023, New Zealander Shane van Gisbergen won the inaugural Chicago Street race in his first start driving for Trackhouses PROJECT91 program Marks created to offer NASCAR opportunities to international driving stars.

        "date": "2025-02-05",

        "article text": "The NFL and USAA, an official NFL Salute to Service Partner, named George Kittle, San Francisco 49ers tight end, as the recipient of the 2024 Salute to Service Award presented by USAA. The award recognizes the exceptional efforts made by members of the NFL family to honor and support the military community.\nKittle will be recognized at NFL Honors presented by Invisalign on Thursday, February 6 during the week of Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans. USAA, a leading provider of insurance, banking and other financial services to U.S. military members, veterans and their families, will contribute $25,000 in Kittles honor to the official aid societies representing each of the military branches. The NFL Foundation will match USAAs donation of $25,000, which will be donated to Kittles military charity of choice.\n49ers tight end George Kittle exemplifies what it means to honor, empower, and connect with the military community. Kittles connection is personal and rooted in family as his Uncle Pat and Grandfather Carl were among loved ones whove served.\nGeorge Kittle continues to show a deep and unwavering dedication to our service members, veterans and their families through his military appreciation efforts which go beyond gestures and truly reflect a heartfelt commitment to those who have served our nation, said USAA Senior Vice President and Head of Military Affairs, Major General (Ret.) John Richardson. Inspired by those in his own family who served, George has become a shining example for the NFL community of how to create lasting and genuine connections with our military, and we salute him as this years recipient of the Salute to Service Award presented by USAA.\nThrough Kittles positivity, he empowers service members by lending his platform and resources. He hosts military and frontline heroes at every game, donating over 400 tickets in the last six years. Through the Founding Hidden Pearls Podcast (HPP) founded in 2020, Kittle and his family amplify community stories, nearly 60 of those involving veterans. Inspired by these stories, he and his family created an app offering free mental health resources to veterans, including the meditative practices he uses while playing. Additionally, Kittle has donated over $250,000 to military nonprofits and further highlighted military organizations through My Cause My Cleats, including the Pat Tillman Foundation, TAPS, Merging Vets and Players (MVP), Operation Freedom Paws and Operation Surf.\nKittle is an active participant in the 49ers Salute to Service programming whose connection with service members goes beyond an initial introduction. After gifting the family of fallen Army soldier Sgt. Martin LaMar Super Bowl tickets, Kittle continues to host them at training camp and keeps Sgt. LaMars Purple Heart in his locker. Army veteran Chris Kleinsorge gifted a uniform he wore in Afghanistan to George Kittle and his wife, during an away game thanking them for the work he has done for the military community. After the exchange, Kittle flew Kleinsorge and his wife to a home game, hugged them on the field and met post-game for meaningful conversation. These stories are only a few instances of countless examples exemplifying Kittles dedication to the military community.\nI am incredibly thankful and honored to be this years Salute to Service Award recipient. This is my fourth time being nominated by the 49ers, which is an absolute honor because its important to me to show gratitude and support to the military, said George Kittle. My appreciation for the military stems from watching my Uncle Pat serve multiple tours with the National Guard and seeing firsthand how much it impacted him and his family while he was overseas. Without my family and their unwavering support, I would not be able to create these genuine and authentic relationships with the real heroes and the ones who should be receiving this award, the active-duty members, Veterans, TAPS and families that have lost loved ones in the line of fire. The support you see for the military around the league is so important and the fact that guys on every team do it, not just the nominees, is awesome. We are allowed to live the lives we live here because of the sacrifices they make, so were just trying to honor them, show our support, and share as much love as we can.\nFans were once again able to vote for their favorite nominees, and the finalists were ultimately decided based on a consensus fan vote, an NFL internal committee alongside USAA. Nominees were also evaluated on the positive impact of their efforts to support the military community, the type of service conducted, the thoroughness of their support and their level of commitment. This years other finalists included Minnesota Vikings running back Aaron Jones and Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan Fox.\nA panel of judges, consisting of representatives from the U.S. military community, the NFL and USAA, will determine the Salute to Service Award recipient, and includes Chad Hennings, Air Force Academy graduate and three-time Super Bowl champion; Jim Mora, Sr., Marine Corps veteran and former NFL head coach; Lenny Bandy, U.S. Marine Corps veteran and NFL Vice President of Security; Major General (Ret.) John Richardson, USAA Senior Vice President and head of Military Affairs, and Joe Cardona, New England Patriots long snapper, U.S. Naval Reservist and 2023 Salute to Service Award recipient.\nBelow is the list of previous Salute to Service Award recipients:\nNFL SEASON           RECIPIENT                                        TEAM2023                           Joe Cardona, Current Player               New England Patriots2022                           Ron Rivera, Former Head Coach        Washington Commanders2021                           Andrew Beck, Current Player             Denver Broncos2020                           Steve Cannon, Vice Chairman,           Atlanta Falcons\nAMB Sports + Entertainment2019                           Donnie Edwards, Former Player         Los Angeles Chargers2018                           Ben Garland, Former Player               Atlanta Falcons2017                           Andre Roberts, Former Player            Atlanta Falcons2016                           Dan Quinn, Current Head Coach        Atlanta Falcons2015                           Vincent Jackson, Late Player              Tampa Bay Buccaneers2014                           Jared Allen, Former Player                 Chicago Bears2013                           John Harbaugh, Current Head Coach Baltimore Ravens2012                           Charles Tillman, Former Player          Chicago Bears2011                           K.S. Bud Adams Jr., Late Owner    Tennessee Titans\nThe Salute to Service Award is part of the NFL and USAAs year-round commitment to recognize and honor the military community.

We understand our commercial partners needs, offering them a solutions-forward pickup truck so they can operate smarter, keep costs low and meet emissions standardswithout compromise.To guide the programs development, ensuring the program supports diverse sectors such as construction, manufacturing, agriculture, and mid-mile delivery,TELO has formed a Steering Committee of industry expertsfamiliar with the nuanced challenges logistics and transportation can present.On top of normal business challenges, fleets with pickups that operate in cities have had to deal with ever increasing traffic, more restrictive parking access, and higher costs for purchase, maintenance, and fuel,said Steering Committee member and Founder ofACME Fleet Solutions, LLC, J Frank Guercio.And, since the early 1990s, pickup trucks have continued to get larger! TELO provides a small truck that offers a BIG solution to all these issues.Sohail Suleman, Founder and CEO ofTRUQIT a company that provides rental trucks by the hour  and a member of TELOs Steering Committee, adds,Lately, trucks have grown so large that the only compelling option for our urban customers is a 20-year-old, two-door Toyota Tacoma. TELO is the only automaker designing with our customers in mind.TELO Trucks thrive in environments where larger vehicles fall short. From mining operations to small suburban streets to underground storage facilities to dense, urban construction sites, TELOs compact design unlocks unprecedented access while maintaining supreme functionality. Better still, TELOs fully-customizable crew cab offers comfortable seating for two-to-five passengers  depending on whether the mid-gate is up or down.In the near future, TELO plans to release an eight passenger option, making the ultra-compact pickup truck the most versatile work vehicle designed to meet a wide-range of commercial applications.For more information about TELO or to pre-order a TELO Truck for only $152  the length in inches of the compact vehicle  please visitwww.telotrucks.com\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/94974/333591/333591-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333591\nThis news content may be integrated into any legitimate news gathering and publishing effort.

The Costume Institute Benefit (also known as The Met Gala®) takes place annually on the first Monday in May and provides the department with its primary source of annual funding for exhibitions, publications, acquisitions, operations, and capital improvements.\n................................................................................................................\nAboutSuperfine: Tailoring Black StyleSuperfine: Tailoring Black Stylepresents a cultural and historical examination of Black style from the 18th century to the present through an exploration of the concept of dandyism. To bring this rich subject to life, various artists have contributed to the exhibition through concepts that amplify topics explored in the curation. In her first-ever exhibition design, artist Torkwase Dyson uses her signature hypershapes to create a series of stand-alone monumental sculptures, or architectural zones, designed to hold questions around Black liferelated to reflection, theatricality, scale, liberation, flight, and transcendenceand amplify moments of tension between motion, scale, and display in visitors experience. The two bespoke mannequin heads on display are by artist Tanda Francis and emulate bronze monuments. One of the works features numerous silhouetted profiles meant to represent a plurality of individuals and community as well as a visualization of the unseen: emerging from a central point is a face inspired by André Grenard Matswa of the Congo, the imaginative revolutionary who is considered the first Sapeur in that vibrant community that arose in the 1920s. Francis created this portrait within the theme of protective styles as a tribute to the unifying experience of function, style, and culture within the African diaspora. Artist and Special Consultant Iké Udé lends his unique expertise and experience as a dandy to curate a section of the exhibition that explores his own work and highlights Julius Soubise, whose style and behavior challenged societal norms in 18th-century London. Artist Tyler Mitchells images for the exhibition catalogue include a selection of dynamic object photography as well as a photo essay that portrays the camaraderie among well-styled Black men across generations. The catalogue also includes more than 30 essays by various thought leaders, artists, and other distinguished voices.\nProgrammingThe Met will host a series of exhibition-related programs and public events for all ages, both at the Museum and at other institutions, prior to the May opening, including a talk at The Apollo Stages at The Victoria Theater on Tuesday, April 8 from 6  7pm; and another at The Billie Holiday Theater at Bed-Stuy Restoration Corporation on Tuesday, April 22 from 6:30pm  7:30pm. Additional programs will include walking tours; interdisciplinary panel discussions exploring various themes in the exhibition; hands-on workshops and demonstrations exploring process, materials, and styling; a design competition for college students, and more. In the Museums fourth collaboration with Metrograph, the independent New York movie theater will present a film series inspired by the exhibition later this fall. Further details on events and programming will be released in the coming weeks.\nExhibition OverviewSuperfine: Tailoring Black Styleexplores the importance of sartorial style to the formation of Black identities in the Atlantic diaspora. The show is inspired by Guest Curator Monica L. Millers 2009 book,Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, and chronicles the ways in which Black people have used dress and fashion to transform their identities and imagine new ways of embodying political and social possibilities. The exhibition interprets the concept as both an aesthetic and a strategy, using garments, paintings, prints, photographs, decorative arts, literary texts, and film to explore this cultural and historical phenomenon from the 18th century to today.Superfineis organized into 12 sections, each representing a characteristic that defines this style: Ownership, Presence, Distinction, Disguise, Freedom, Champion, Respectability, Jook, Heritage, Beauty, Cool, and Cosmopolitanism. Together, these characteristics demonstrate how the figure is defined and self-fashions and how their style raises notions of assimilation, distinction, and resistanceall while telling a story about self and society inflected by race, gender, class, and sexuality.Monica L. Miller, Guest Curator, and Chair of Africana Studies, Barnard College, Columbia University, said: Dandyism can seem frivolous, but it often poses a challenge to or a transcendence of social and cultural hierarchies. It asks questions about identity, representation, and mobility in relation to race, class, gender, sexuality, and power. The exhibition explores this concept as both a pronouncement and a provocation. The exhibition title refers to superfine not only as the quality of a particular fabricsuperfine woolbut also as a particular attitude related to feeling especially good in ones own body, in clothes that express the self. Wearing superfine and being superfine are, in many ways, the subject of this exhibition. And the separateness, distinction, and movement between these two states of being in the African diaspora from the 1780s to today animates the show.Andrew Bolton, Curator in Charge, The Costume Institute, commented: Superfine: Tailoring Black Styleis our departments first exhibition devoted to menswear in more than 20 years. The show also reflects our ongoing commitment to diversifying our exhibitions in a way that is authentic to The Costume Institute. What makes it possible to translate Monicas book,Slaves to Fashion, into an exhibition is our collection of high-style menswear, which serves as a foundation for imagining and realizing this important sartorial history.The shows conceptual framework is inspired by Zora Neale Hurstons 1934 essayCharacteristics of Negro Expression. With the exception of Jook, each of the 12 characteristics in the exhibition were newly selected by Miller and The Costume Institutes curatorial team. The first six sections comprise primarily historical objects, while the final six feature predominantly objects from the 20th century on.Among the first six sections,Disguiseexamines an earlier characteristic of fashionhow it can be used to conceal and reveal, particularly for the enslaved, who understood that clothing and dress marked them as individuals. This section shows how race, class, and gender cross-dressing enabled Black people to convey the ways in which identity is dependent on, and can be manipulated by, conventions of dress. Highlighted in this section are the stories of the formerly enslaved couple Ellen and William Craft, who fled from Georgia to Philadelphia in 1848, and prominent 20th-century entertainers Ralph Kerwinoe and Stormé De Lavarie, who each donned typical male attire as an expression of their nonconforming gender identities. Objects on view include an frontispiece from the Crafts 1860 memoir, a top hat dating from 1855, and a suit by Who Decides War from the fall/winter 202425 collection.TheChampionsection explores the role of the uniform and how athletic dress can illuminate the history of discrimination and stereotypes of Black men in sports as well as the way in which athletic success for Black men can be a mode of distinction and a route to status as a style icon.Objects in this section range from 19th-century jockey silks to a 1974 issue ofJetmagazine featuring Walt Fraizer on the coverone of the first Black athletes to have a major shoe deal, with Pumaand ensembles by Saul Nash and Denim Tears.Respectabilityconsiders the politics of assimilation, activism, and propriety and the ways in which Black political and cultural leaders, such as W.E.B. Du Bois and Frederick Douglass, have long understood grooming and dress as tools of power and distinction. Tailoring traditions were often passed down within Black families in the African diaspora; since the late 19th century, Black students could learn these techniques as part of their education at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), which have been essential to the creation of a progressive Black vanguard. Objects on view include pieces owned and worn by Douglass, photographs of Du Bois, a suit owned by André Leon Talley, and an ensemble from the 2023 collaboration between Morehouse College and James M. Jeter, Creative Director for Ralph Lauren.Another section,Beauty, inspired by a 1969 poem by Nikki Giovanni, highlights the beauty, confidence, and sheer fabulousness of style and attitudes that begin to emerge among Black males in the 1970s and 80s. Following the seismic social justice movements of the 1960s, Black men converted their previous social invisibility into a form of radiance that relied on their hypervisibility, pride, and panache and allowed for an experimentation with norms of masculinity, gender identity, and sexuality. Rebuking stereotypes of Black masculinity as simply strong and hard, wardrobes began to feature leather and drapery, lace, ruffles, and sequins, emphasizing a mode of dress that spans the spectrum of gender as part of its transgressive power. Highlighting this section are contemporary ensembles by Marvin Desroc, Theophilio, and LaQuan Smith.Coolexamines the turn to stylized casual dress that revolutionized fashion from the 1960s to the 1980s, with Black designers and the wearers of their clothes at the center of redefining how people dress for work and play. Cardigans, tracksuits, and denim, born out of a resistance to constraining formality, demonstrate the art of being unbothered and nimbleeven in politics, where the Kariba suit replaced Western suiting as official, formal dress in Jamaica in the 1970s. This easeful form communicates cool, an undefinable concept that relies on the creation of a mood or an atmosphere in which fashion, accessories, pose, and gait come together to attract notice and desire. Exemplifying this nonchalant yet highly curated approach to self-presentation are pieces by Botter, Grace Wales Bonner, and Bianca Saunders.CreditsThe exhibition is organized by Monica L. Miller, Guest Curator, Professor and Chair of Africana Studies, Barnard College, Columbia University, with The Costume Institutes Andrew Bolton, Curator in Charge; William DeGregorio, Associate Curator; and Amanda Garfinkel, Associate Curator; and with help from Kai Marcel, Research Assistant, The Costume Institute.In addition, artist Torkwase Dyson created the conceptual design for the exhibition, which is realized in the galleries by The Mets Design Department and SAT3 Studio. Artist Tanda Francis designed the two bespoke sculpted mannequin heads used throughout the galleries. Artist Iké Udé served as Special Consultant.Miller and The Costume Institutes curatorial team consulted with an advisory committee of scholars who provided feedback on the exhibition. The committee members are Dr. Christine Checinska, Jason Cyrus, Thelma Golden, Deborah Tulani Salahu-Din, Dr. Jonathan Michael Square, and, from The Met, Dr. Denise Murrell, Merryl H. and James S. Tisch Curator at Large.Related ContentFeaturing new photography by artist Tyler Mitchell, an illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition and includes more than 30 essays by various thought leaders, artists, and other distinguished voices.

        "article text": "Team BAHRAIN VICTORIOUS contested the Al Ula Tour with a young team. Before the last stage, Rainer Kepplinger had secured 2nd place on GC thanks to strong climbing performances. But deep in the finale of the conclusive stage, he missed out on the decisive echelon and, as a consequence, dropped back to 5th on GC.\nThroughout its five stages, the Al Ula Tour served up three opportunities for sprinters and two finales spiked with steep climbs. As for Team BAHRAIN VICTORIOUS, Rainer Kepplinger was the protected rider for GC, Andrea Pasqualon was to make sure everyone was in tune with the sports directors plans, and Alberto Bruttomesso was free to try his hands or rather legs at the sprints. Completing the teams line-up for the Al Ula Tour were Max van der Meulen, Nicolo Buratti, Zak Erzen and Oliver Stockwell. As for the three stages that were decided in sprints of larger groups, Alberto Bruttomesso rode to two 8th places and a 9th place, facing a stacked field of strong sprinters. Throughout the initial four days, the team was riding very attentively and often was seen setting the pace at the sharp end of the peloton.\nAt the two mountaintop finishes a clear hierarchy could be seen as Tom Pidcock was the best climber with Rainer Kepplinger following right behind. This resulted in two podium results as Kepplinger finished stage 2 in 2nd and stage 4 in 3rd. Thus, before the final stage, the Austrian was sitting in 2nd on GC as was Team BAHRAIN VICTORIOUS in the team classification. With Max van der Meulen in 9th, another rider of the team managed to make his way into the top 10 on GC. As the conclusive stage finishing at the Al Ula Camel Cup Track did not look hard enough on paper to shake up things, the situation looked very promising from the teams perspective.\nBut as the wind thwarted the plans of Team BAHRAIN VICTORIOUS for the conclusive stage. Throughout the first two hours of racing, the riders managed to keep themselves at the sharp end of the race or mend any dangerous situations. But in the final hour of racing, everyone except for Alberto Bruttomesso got dropped from the first echelon, conceding 57 seconds to the first group on the road at the finish. As a consequence, Rainer Kepplinger dropped from 2nd to 5th on GC and Max van der Meulen dropped out of the top 10. At least the riders managed to hold on to 2nd place in team classification, but this did little to soothe the disappointment on the final day of the Al Ula Tour.\nRESULTS:5TH AL ULA TOURSTAGE 2: AL ULA OLD TOWN - BIR JAYDAH MOUNTAIN WIRKAH, 130.6KM1.

The immediate impacts typically include loss of life, injuries, displacement, and destruction of infrastructure, while the long-term effects can involve economic hardship, health crises, psychological trauma, and disruption of essential services such as education.Our partnership with SEEDS has a multi-phase approach, starting with emergency response and relief, progressing through rehabilitation and reconstruction, and ultimately aiming for sustainable development and resilience building. The project aims to address the specific needs of communities affected by disasters by providing immediate relief, supporting long-term recovery, building resilience, promoting inclusivity, and ensuring effective resource mobilization and implementation through continuous monitoring and evaluation.This partnership marks a significant step towards building resilient and sustainable communities in Assam and Uttar Pradesh. By addressing both immediate relief and long-term recovery, we aim to empower the most vulnerable populations to withstand future disasters and climate challenges. This collaboration is not just about rebuilding what was lost, but about creating a foundation for a brighter, more inclusive future.Kristina Svartling, Project Manager at H&M FoundationVulnerable populations, including the elderly, children, disabled individuals, and economically disadvantaged groups, are particularly at risk when a disaster hits and often bear the brunt of these challenges. Environmental and geographic factors, like coastal locations and climate change, also exacerbate the vulnerabilities. The funds from H&M Foundation are estimated to reach a quarter of a million people and are directed to Assam and Uttar Pradesh. The project is focused on:Vulnerable communitiesaffected by natural disasters, including excluded groups,women, children, elderly, minorities, and single parents.Disaster-affected households,particularly marginalized groups such as landless farmers, indigenous communities, and people with disabilities.Nature and surroundings,as recipients of interventions aimed at preservation, restoration, and sustainable management in disaster-affected areas.The overall goal of the project is to go beyond the actual disaster and create resilient, sustainable, and equitable disaster-affected communities. Whereas one portion of the budget is allocated to immediate relief efforts, such as food, water, shelter, and medical supplies, a major part of the budget is allocated towards recovery and preparedness efforts. By addressing key areas such as shelter, livelihood, water sanitation and health, the target communities are fostered to be resilient and better equipped to withstand future disasters and climate crisis. Further, environmental sustainability is integrated in the project with the aim of providing long-term health of eco-systems and communities. By implementing sustainable infrastructure such as waste management, renewable energy, and biodiversity conservation, environmental well-being and community resilience are recognized as interconnected systems.Key to success of the project is the involvement of the affected communities themselves, leveraging local knowledge and fostering collaboration among government agencies, non-profits, the private sector, and community members. The project also has a systems change approach and aims to address for instance policies, practices, resource flows and behavioural change.\nProject time period 2024  2027\nFinancial Support: SEK 7,500,000\nFocus Areas: Disaster Management\nPartners: SEEDS\nCountries: India\nDisaster affected communities often face both immediate and long-term challenges. The immediate impacts typically include loss of life, injuries, displacement, and destruction of infrastructure, while the long-term effects can involve economic hardship, health crises, psychological trauma, and disruption of essential services such as education.\nOur partnership with SEEDS has a multi-phase approach, starting with emergency response and relief, progressing through rehabilitation and reconstruction, and ultimately aiming for sustainable development and resilience building. The project aims to address the specific needs of communities affected by disasters by providing immediate relief, supporting long-term recovery, building resilience, promoting inclusivity, and ensuring effective resource mobilization and implementation through continuous monitoring and evaluation.\nThis partnership marks a significant step towards building resilient and sustainable communities in Assam and Uttar Pradesh. By addressing both immediate relief and long-term recovery, we aim to empower the most vulnerable populations to withstand future disasters and climate challenges. This collaboration is not just about rebuilding what was lost, but about creating a foundation for a brighter, more inclusive future.\nKristina Svartling, Project Manager at H&M Foundation\nVulnerable populations, including the elderly, children, disabled individuals, and economically disadvantaged groups, are particularly at risk when a disaster hits and often bear the brunt of these challenges. Environmental and geographic factors, like coastal locations and climate change, also exacerbate the vulnerabilities. The funds from H&M Foundation are estimated to reach a quarter of a million people and are directed to Assam and Uttar Pradesh. The project is focused on:\nThe overall goal of the project is to go beyond the actual disaster and create resilient, sustainable, and equitable disaster-affected communities. Whereas one portion of the budget is allocated to immediate relief efforts, such as food, water, shelter, and medical supplies, a major part of the budget is allocated towards recovery and preparedness efforts. By addressing key areas such as shelter, livelihood, water sanitation and health, the target communities are fostered to be resilient and better equipped to withstand future disasters and climate crisis. Further, environmental sustainability is integrated in the project with the aim of providing long-term health of eco-systems and communities. By implementing sustainable infrastructure such as waste management, renewable energy, and biodiversity conservation, environmental well-being and community resilience are recognized as interconnected systems.\nKey to success of the project is the involvement of the affected communities themselves, leveraging local knowledge and fostering collaboration among government agencies, non-profits, the private sector, and community members. The project also has a systems change approach and aims to address for instance policies, practices, resource flows and behavioural change.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/333588/333588-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333588\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

CONFE, a local entity with more than 46 years experience, represents a network of +100 organisations in Mexico, will manage this new mens, womens and kids footwear establishment in Mexico City, where nine people with different disabilities work.\nInditex currently has 16 for&from stores which between them have generated employment opportunities for over 850 people with different abilities and more than 8.5 million for the charitable work done by the various managing organisations. Moreover, this initiative seeks to create beacon retail venues that raise awareness about the importance of integrating people with disabilities by fostering inclusion and accessibility and eliminating barriers.\nFor&from dates back to 2002 when Massimo Dutti opened the platforms first store in Palafolls (Barcelona).

        "article text": "Hollywood meets the Art of Design and Engineering: Porsche Design is proud to announce that Orlando Bloom will be the new Brand Ambassador for the brands Timepiece and Eyewear collections.\nKnown for his celebrated roles in numerous films and regarded as one of Hollywoods most stylish leading men, Orlando Bloom is also a long-time Porsche enthusiast. His appreciation for the exceptional design, technical innovation and functionality that define Porsche Design makes this an ideal partnership. In the new image campaign for Porsche Design, Orlando Bloom wears the iconic Chronograph 1 timepiece, along with seven selected models of the brands innovative sunglasses and prescription eyewear.\nIts a great honor to represent Porsche Design as Brand Ambassador. From our first conversation, I was excited about the idea of a partnership. I immediately sensed that the Porsche Design team and I share a mutual passion for great design and a similar mindset. The brand has a unique way of translating the unmistakable design and timeless elegance of icons like the Porsche 911 into lifestyle products. This blend of sports car-inspired aesthetics, unique heritage, and exclusive lifestyle truly fascinates me. Its exciting to now be part of this success story, says Bloom.\nOrlando Bloom is a perfect match for Porsche Design because he truly embodies our lifestyle, as well as our shared values of authenticity, style, and a passion for perfection, all of which are reflected in the commitment hes made to his craft. As an acclaimed actor with international appeal and popularity around the world, Orlando will further enhance Porsche Designs global awareness and positive perception of our brand. We are so proud to have him on our team and look forward to partnering on many inspiring and innovative projects together, says Stefan Buescher, CEO of Porsche Lifestyle Group.\nThe 911 among watches\nThe highlight of the Timepiece campaign is the Chronograph 1  All Black Numbered Edition. This model draws on the heritage of the iconic Chronograph I, designed in 1972 by F. A. Porsche, the designer of the legendary Porsche 911. As the first all-black chronograph, it revolutionized the watch industry and was directly inspired by the dashboard of the Porsche 911. In 2022, it was completely re-engineered before being reissued by Porsche Design. Like all Porsche Design Timepieces, it is crafted by hand in Porsches watch manufactory in Solothurn/Switzerland where excellence in automotive engineering fuses with the art of Swiss watchmaking. The campaign visuals, designed in the style of the current Timepiece campaign, are presented in the brands signature colors of black and red, and were staged alongside the watchs source of inspiration, the Porsche 911.\nA visionary collaboration\nOne of the worlds most unique eyewear designs, the iconic P8478 model takes center stage in the Eyewear campaign, along with six other sunglasses and prescription styles from the new 2025 Porsche Design Eyewear Collection. In 1978 and designed by F. A. Porsche, the Porsche Design P8478 made its mark in history as the first-ever sunglass model to feature an interchangeable lens system. Thanks to this innovative quick-release mechanism, the teardrop-shaped 6-base curve lenses, supplied in various colors, can be swapped easily, allowing for seamless adaptation to different light conditions. Crafted from extremely lightweight titanium and scratch-proof, virtually unbreakable polycarbonate, the P8478 combines innovative design with maximum performance and durability.\nAbout Porsche Design\nIn 1963, Professor Ferdinand Alexander Porsche created one of the most iconic design objects in contemporary history: the Porsche 911. Following his vision to take the principles and myth of Porsche beyond the automotive world, he created the exclusive lifestyle brand Porsche Design in 1972. His philosophy and design language can still be seen in all Porsche Design products today. Every Porsche Design product stands for extraordinary precision and perfection, boasts a high level of technological innovation and seamlessly combines intelligent functionality and puristic design. Created by Studio F. A. Porsche in Austria, our products are sold worldwide in Porsche Design stores, high-end department stores, exclusive specialist retailers and the officialonline store.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/333577/333577-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333577\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "In late October, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published information about lead exposure risks from private well water and its potential impact on childrens health. This is an important topic as the agency believes millions of households across the United States rely on private well water for drinking.According to the EPA:There is no requirement for monitoring lead or other contaminants in private water wells, as they are not federally regulated, and most states have limited regulations on private drinking water wells. Accordingly, it is important that households with private wells regularly test the quality of their drinking water.While lead is rarely found in source water, it can enter water through the corrosion of plumbing materials such as old lead pipes, and brass or chrome-plated brass faucets and fixtures. These can leach significant amounts of lead into the water, especially with hot water. Several years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cautioned that private wells more than 20 years old could contain lead in the packer element that is used to help seal the well above the well screen. CDC also warned that some brands of older submersible pumps used in wells may also contain leaded-brass components.The only way to know if lead is a potential problem for those dependent on private wells is to have the water tested, said Joseph Frasca, Senior Vice President of Marketing at EMSL Analytical, Inc. At EMSL Analytical, we provide laboratory services to assess lead exposure hazards. Our water quality testing experts can also analyze the physical characteristics of water samples and test for a wide range of microbial and chemical contaminants. We also offer sampling supplies and easy-to-use test kits to quickly and affordably provide this important information to private well owners.EMSL sponsored an educational video about private wells and testing drinking water quality several years ago that can still be seen at:https://youtu.be/9mtMqsTiNagTo learn more about lead and water testing, please visitwww.EMSL.com, emailinfo@EMSL.com, or call (800) 220-3675.

When she tries to implement necessary reforms, Parker is confronted with resistance from the underpaid, ill-equipped and chronically fatigued hospital staff who only survive with an indispensable dose of black humor. But in the face of an increasingly merciless health care system, the battered team must put aside their differences and pull together to save lives.\nBerlin ER stars Jones and Popadić alongside an ensemble cast that includes Şafak Şengül (Rabiye Kurnaz vs. George W.

My signature shoe is worth the wait  engineered for my game and my style, and built to motivate the next generation to go big. Just wait to see what we do with it.The AOne is designed to deliver the comfort and versatility required by one of the greatest players in the world, offering Wilson, other elite athletes and fans of the game an optimal combination of cushioning, traction, fit and support.The silhouettes Cushlon ST2 foam works with a firmer base to deliver explosive responsiveness and smooth, cushioned landings so hoopers stay ready for every play. A reimagined traction pattern lets athletes cut, pivot and move side to side with precision, while a supportive insole and breathable mesh upper help athletes lock in for unstoppable, dynamic movement.The AOne is meant to go the distance, taking control from the jump and dominating the floor on every play, says Wilson. From the beginning, we designed the shoe to both support my game and to provide young hoopers a tool to help them level up. The AOne aces that assignment, and we took the time to really get it right in order to deliver exactly what I need to push my performance and inspire the next generation to give it their all on every play.While the AOnes performance is undeniable, its bold look further distinguishes the silhouette as a reflection of Wilsons influence on the sport, with personalized design details that recall her family history and carry forward the vibrancy and unapologetic realness central to her style.Pearl motifs and finishes define the silhouette and signature collection, nodding to the necklace Wilsons grandmother gifted her as a child, providing her a wearable symbol of strength. The outsole of Wilsons signature sneaker pays additional tribute to her grandmother, including her message from Wilsons book: As a matter of fact,the best is yet to come.Celtic symbols for mom and dad pay homage to Wilsons parents, further harking to her belief that family means everything. A postgame quote that speaks to her trademark tenacity is immortalized on the heel: Weakness, weakness. We dont have time for that.The Pink Aura launch colorway symbolizes Wilsons ability to lead with confidence, loyalty and passion, with layers of pink creating a gradual ambiance thats flush with Leo energy and lights up the court in her favorite color.Rounding out the silhouette is Wilsons new signature logo, inspired by the star she draws inside the A of her signature while referencing her role as an A1 hooper who inspires kids to reach for their dreams. With that motivation in mind, the Nike AOne will be available in kids sizes as small as 1Y.In Aja, the next generation has a beacon to look to  an inspiration point, says Ben Nethongkome, lead designer for the AOne footwear. She wants to lead the charge for young hoopers to strive for greatness. We designed the Nike AOne so that when girls lace up, they channel Ajas encouragement through her footwear, knowing they can be like her one day.That confident yet stylish vibe carries over to Wilsons signature apparel collection, which speaks to her personal style across eight pieces for women, men and kids. The collection conveys a contemporary aesthetic that pairs high fashion with bold looks and classically timeless sports style for a system of dress that can be worn together or combined with other pieces.At the center of the collection is Wilsons ASymmetric tight, which mirrors her distinctive DIY look that was originally born from her pursuit of on-court comfort following an injury during her rookie year and has since evolved into a one-legged aesthetic adopted by competitors across the athletic landscape.A cropped womens hoodie includes a sateen-lined hood to keep athletes hair styled and on-point, along with premium metal drawstring finishes for an elevated touch. An identical drawstring treatment extends to sateen shorts, while cropped and full-length T-shirts offer everyone an entryway into Wilsons bold aesthetic.Completing the collection are kid-right offerings to help serve and inspire the next generation of hoopers, including the ASymmetric tight, hoodie, mesh shorts and T-shirt.When athletes wear my shoe or any of the pieces from my collection, I want them to feel the power behind that logo: the power to dream big, then put in the work  in style and confidence, says Wilson.Wilson wasnamed to Nikes roster of signature athletesin spring 2024, joining a growing team of women who have partnered with the brand to develop signature collections with deeper meaning. A longtime Nike athlete, Wilson has been a part ofNikes Athlete Think Tanksince 2022, helping inform how the brand creates innovative products, meaningful experiences and supportive communities for women and girls.Wilson also recently partnered with Nike and other elite athletes to craft a vision forthe future of Nike Airby harnessing cutting-edge technologies and artificial intelligence in collaboration with the Nike innovation team.The Nike AOne sneaker, apparel collection and Calm slide will be available at SNKRS,nike.comand select retail locations in May 2025.Click into the gallery below to learn more about the Nike AOne signature footwear and apparel collection.\nAja Wilsonhas earned two WNBA rings,two Olympic gold medals, an NCAA crown and three WNBA MVP awards.\nAnd that was all before leveling up withher Nike signature shoe, which is designed to support her game and push her performance to new heights.\nEnter the Nike AOne: a standout silhouette that puts competitors on notice with a curated mix of performance benefits engineered to help Wilson lace up, lock in and leave defenders in the dust.\nIf you think youve seen my best, think again, says Wilson. We worked for over two years to create the Nike AOne to help me redefine the limits of greatness and advance the game to another level.

A reimagined traction pattern lets athletes cut, pivot and move side to side with precision, while a supportive insole and breathable mesh upper help athletes lock in for unstoppable, dynamic movement.\nThe AOne is meant to go the distance, taking control from the jump and dominating the floor on every play, says Wilson. From the beginning, we designed the shoe to both support my game and to provide young hoopers a tool to help them level up. The AOne aces that assignment, and we took the time to really get it right in order to deliver exactly what I need to push my performance and inspire the next generation to give it their all on every play.\nWhile the AOnes performance is undeniable, its bold look further distinguishes the silhouette as a reflection of Wilsons influence on the sport, with personalized design details that recall her family history and carry forward the vibrancy and unapologetic realness central to her style.\nPearl motifs and finishes define the silhouette and signature collection, nodding to the necklace Wilsons grandmother gifted her as a child, providing her a wearable symbol of strength. The outsole of Wilsons signature sneaker pays additional tribute to her grandmother, including her message from Wilsons book: As a matter of fact,the best is yet to come.\nCeltic symbols for mom and dad pay homage to Wilsons parents, further harking to her belief that family means everything. A postgame quote that speaks to her trademark tenacity is immortalized on the heel: Weakness, weakness. We dont have time for that.\nThe Pink Aura launch colorway symbolizes Wilsons ability to lead with confidence, loyalty and passion, with layers of pink creating a gradual ambiance thats flush with Leo energy and lights up the court in her favorite color.\nRounding out the silhouette is Wilsons new signature logo, inspired by the star she draws inside the A of her signature while referencing her role as an A1 hooper who inspires kids to reach for their dreams. With that motivation in mind, the Nike AOne will be available in kids sizes as small as 1Y.\nIn Aja, the next generation has a beacon to look to  an inspiration point, says Ben Nethongkome, lead designer for the AOne footwear. She wants to lead the charge for young hoopers to strive for greatness. We designed the Nike AOne so that when girls lace up, they channel Ajas encouragement through her footwear, knowing they can be like her one day.\nThat confident yet stylish vibe carries over to Wilsons signature apparel collection, which speaks to her personal style across eight pieces for women, men and kids. The collection conveys a contemporary aesthetic that pairs high fashion with bold looks and classically timeless sports style for a system of dress that can be worn together or combined with other pieces.\nAt the center of the collection is Wilsons ASymmetric tight, which mirrors her distinctive DIY look that was originally born from her pursuit of on-court comfort following an injury during her rookie year and has since evolved into a one-legged aesthetic adopted by competitors across the athletic landscape.\nA cropped womens hoodie includes a sateen-lined hood to keep athletes hair styled and on-point, along with premium metal drawstring finishes for an elevated touch. An identical drawstring treatment extends to sateen shorts, while cropped and full-length T-shirts offer everyone an entryway into Wilsons bold aesthetic.\nCompleting the collection are kid-right offerings to help serve and inspire the next generation of hoopers, including the ASymmetric tight, hoodie, mesh shorts and T-shirt.\nWhen athletes wear my shoe or any of the pieces from my collection, I want them to feel the power behind that logo: the power to dream big, then put in the work  in style and confidence, says Wilson.\nWilson wasnamed to Nikes roster of signature athletesin spring 2024, joining a growing team of women who have partnered with the brand to develop signature collections with deeper meaning. A longtime Nike athlete, Wilson has been a part ofNikes Athlete Think Tanksince 2022, helping inform how the brand creates innovative products, meaningful experiences and supportive communities for women and girls.\nWilson also recently partnered with Nike and other elite athletes to craft a vision forthe future of Nike Airby harnessing cutting-edge technologies and artificial intelligence in collaboration with the Nike innovation team.\nThe Nike AOne sneaker, apparel collection and Calm slide will be available at SNKRS,nike.comand select retail locations in May 2025.\nClick into the gallery below to learn more about the Nike AOne signature footwear and apparel collection.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/333549/333549-1.png)\nWebWireID333549\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Schmitz Cargobull, Europes leading manufacturer of semi-trailers, and the Mayor of Vreden, Dr Tom Tenostendarp, are delighted that planning permission has been granted for an extension to Schmitz Cargobulls delivery area for refrigerated and box body semi-trailers at the companys site in Vreden (Germany).Construction is due to begin in the first half of 2025 and will take around one year. With this significant investment, an additional area of around 11 hectares with 750 new vehicle parking spaces will be created. As a result, the vehicle delivery process will be sped up, which will also protect the environment by reducing the amount of transportation needed.\n150 tonnes of CO2 saving per year\nThe expansion will reduce the number of external parking areas rented in the vicinity of the Schmitz Cargobull plant for storing vehicles until they are collected, from more than 20 to 10. The remaining ten parking areas are located in direct proximity to the Schmitz Cargobull plant, with the farthest just six kilometres away.The large parking area on site is also important in terms of sustainability. At the moment, we have to park some vehicles a number of kilometres away from the plant until they are ready to be picked up by the customer, as there is not enough parking space at the delivery centre. Thanks to the 750 extra parking spaces, the number of transport kilometres required can be reduced by around 200,000 kilometres a year, which corresponds to a saving of around 80 per cent. This will significantly reduce strain on local traffic and will also cut CO2 emissions from our in-house transport by around 80 per cent, which will save approximately 150 tonnes of CO2 per year, adds Plant Director Christian Glebe.An increase in the use of electrically powered yard vehicles will also contribute to greater sustainability. This environmentally friendly technology will not only reduce emissions for a cleaner environment but will also lower noise pollution for the local area.With this investment in the Vreden site, Schmitz Cargobull is strengthening its position as an innovative and responsible market leader in the commercial vehicles industry and showcasing how economic success and environmental responsibility can go together.\nCaption:Christian Glebe (Vreden Plant Director, right) and Michael Franek (Head of Production Technology at Schmitz Cargobull and expansion project lead, 3rd from left) welcomed Dr Tom Tenostendarp (Mayor of Vreden, 2nd from left) and Joachim Hartmann (Head of Urban Development, City of Vreden, left) to the factory in mid-January to showcase the building project in person.\nAbout Schmitz Cargobull\nSchmitz Cargobull is the leading manufacturer of semi-trailers for temperature-controlled freight, general cargo and bulk goods in Europe and a pioneer in digital solutions for trailer services and improved connectivity. The company also manufactures transport refrigeration machines for refrigerated semi-trailers for temperature-controlled freight transport.

        "article text": "Honda has provided a first look at its innovative approach to manufacture electric vehicles (EV) by late 2025 at the Honda EV Hub in Ohio, detailing the companys flexible approach that uniquely positions Honda to build internal combustion engine (ICE), hybrid-electric, and battery electric vehicles (EVs) on the same production lines. In retooling the Marysville Auto Plant (MAP), East Liberty Auto Plant (ELP) and Anna Engine Plant (AEP), an investment that will reach over $1 billion, Honda has reimagined manufacturing to create a work environment that is more human-friendly and environmentally responsible while achieving the highest levels of quality, efficiency and value for customers.\nThe Honda EV Hub provides Honda with the flexibility to produce ICE, hybrid-electric and EV models on the same production lines so we can quickly respond to shifting customer needs and market conditions\" said Bob Schwyn, senior vice president, Honda Development & Manufacturing of America, LLC. \"Beyond adding the capability to produce EVs, we completely reimagined our approach to manufacturing, transforming the Honda production environment with more human-friendly processes and sustainable manufacturing practices\"\nThe Honda EV Hub will begin EV production in late 2025 with the all-newAcura RSX EVfollowed by Honda EV models based on the Honda 0 SUV and Honda 0 Saloon prototypes the company debuted on January, 7 at CES 2025 in Las Vegas. Honda also debuted its original vehicle operating system (OS), the ASIMO OS, for use in Honda 0 Series models. The use of the ASIMO name pays homage to the beloved Honda ASIMO robot and the \"Wise\" value of the Honda 0 Series. More information on the Honda 0 Series models and related announcements at CES can be foundhere.\nHonda announced plans to establish the Honda EV Hub in Ohio in October 2022, based on the companys vision to make zero emissions vehicles represent 100% of its vehicle sales by 2040. Honda and LG Energy Solution committed to invest $3.5 billion in a new JV battery facility, L-H Battery Company, with the overall investment projected to reach $4.4 billion. The facility will have an annual capacity of approximately 40GWh, with production scheduled to start in late 2025.\nIn addition to serving as the starting point for the global production of the new Honda 0 Series EVs, the Honda EV Hub is playing a critical role in developing the knowledge and expertise for EV technology and production to be shared with other Honda plants in North America and globally. Details on the retooling efforts at the Marysville Auto Plant, East Liberty Auto Plant and Anna Engine Plant, can be found in the backgrounder at the end of this news release.\nTriple Action to ZeroHonda engineers have utilized the opportunity of reimagining manufacturing at the Honda EV Hub to implement energy-saving and other environmentally responsible initiatives in line with the companys Triple Action to Zero approach. Triple Action to Zero is a comprehensive strategy aimed at achieving zero environmental impact by 2050, through three critical action areas: carbon neutrality, clean energy, and resource circulation.\nAll three plants in the Honda EV Hub, MAP, ELP and AEP, play pivotal roles in this initiative and have already begun adopting new processes and equipment to reduce the companys environmental impact.\nHonda Manufacturing in OhioHonda has produced automobiles in Ohio for over 40 years, beginning in November 1982 with the start of automobile production at the Marysville Auto Plant.\nHonda established U.S. manufacturing operations in Marysville in 1979 with the start of motorcycle production. Today, over 12,000 associates support Honda manufacturing in Ohio, with five plants that represent a total capital investment of $13 billion and the capacity to produce 460,000 Honda and Acura automobiles, 1.18 million automobile engines, and over 1 million automobile transmissions and two-motor hybrid systems, using domestic and globally sourced parts.\nThe companys five Ohio manufacturing facilities include three auto plants, the Marysville Auto Plant, East Liberty Auto Plant and Performance Manufacturing Center, as well as the Anna Engine Plant and transmission plant in Russells Point. The company has invested more than $1.4 billion in these facilities over the past six years, continually modernizing equipment and adopting new technologies to advance quality and efficiency for Honda and Acura customers here and around the world. Now, Honda is establishing a new EV Hub for the start of EV production in the U.S. including an investment of over $1 billion to re-tool its existing auto and powertrain plants in Ohio for production of electric vehicles, as well as $3.5 billion with LG Energy Solution to establish a joint venture EV battery plant in Fayette County, Ohio.\nBACKGROUNDER:Honda Creates A Flexible, Sustainable and Human-friendly Production Environment\nHonda began auto production in America over 40 years ago at the Marysville Auto Plant (MAP), and the plant is once again serving as a pioneer for the company and the auto industry. Honda has implemented several new technologies at MAP to support flexible manufacturing. This began in December 2023, when MAP, East Liberty Auto Plant (ELP) and Anna Engine Plant (AEP), began removing equipment and infrastructure to make way for innovation.\nFollowing are highlights of the innovation and transformation at each facility in the Honda EV Hub:\nMarysville Auto PlantMAP consolidated its two production lines, removing much of Line 2 to create the capability to produce EVs on the same line with ICE and hybrid vehicles, as well as other areas of the plant to accommodate the new responsibility as the first Honda plant globally to assemble EV battery packs. This also created more versatile space on the production line for associates to work and enable efficient parts delivery.\nAnna Engine PlantAEP is adding megacasting of EV battery cases to the long list of components the plant has produced since it began production of motorcycle engines 40 years ago. This history includes engines and engine components, transmissions, camshafts, crankshafts, and high-tech CVT components. The EV Battery Case will serve as the main frame structure for the floor of Honda and Acura EVs.\nEast Liberty Auto PlantELP is also undertaking significant innovation as it prepares for EV production.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/333545/333545-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333545\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

They leave behind and disseminate a legacy of hazardous debris.\nAs Southern California wildland-urban interface fires are 100% contained, the recovery process and cleanup begin. Cleaning up a property can be dangerous as there can be hazardous materials on the ground, inside homes and businesses, and in the air.Cleaning up after a wildfire is not as simple scooping up debris with a bulldozer. Impacted sites will need to be assessed for hazardous materials from paints to damaged propane cylinders, to asbestos before any debris removal can begin. Dust controls will need to be implemented. Air monitoring upwind and downwind may need to occur during cleanup. Residents, business owners, and employees can be exposed to arsenic, asbestos, lead, and other harmful materials during the cleanup of nearby debris piles. Moving debris piles or even wind activity can release hazards into the air, where they can wind up miles away into other communities.Wildland-urban interface fires like the Eaton and Palisades fires leave behind more than a wake of burned structures and hillsides. They leave behind and disseminate a legacy of hazardous debris. These compounds can affect the soil and nearby water sources. The contaminants can become aerosolized and enter your home or business both during the fire and after the fire, said Derrick Denis, Senior Vice President, Clark Seif Clark, Inc. (CSC). In some instances, there are also hazardous materials in the fire debris that are regulated by local, state, and federal agencies. Hazards like asbestos, lead, and nickel can be measured in the settled dust and debris that entered a structure. Cleaning may be needed to return the site to a pre-loss condition. Mr. Denis continued, CSC has developed assessment methods for determining if your property is impacted by settled hazards, we develop pragmatic cleaning protocols for your vendors to follow, we conduct clearance testing to verify the efficacy of cleaning efforts, and we provide recommendations for modifying your property to protect cleaned areas from becoming impacted again.To help in these situations, the industrial hygiene, building science, and environmental professionals at CSC offer indoor and outdoor testing services to identify and mitigate exposure risks to wildfire debris, smoke residues, and other pollutants. CSC also provides training resources on the proper use of respirators and personal protective equipment (PPE), air monitoring services, building assessments to evaluate filtration and engineering controls, smoke residue and odor investigations, health and safety compliance, and more.Wildfire recovery is a community-wide effort that requires both individual and collective action.

        "article text": "Global standardization and clear orientation for all customers: Audi is strengthening the alphanumeric format of its nomenclature. Going forward, it will represent the size and positioning of each model globally in a unified and transparent way. The previous distinction between electric vehicles and models with combustion engines according to their number no longer applies.\nThis decision is the result of intensive discussions and also follows the wishes of our customers as well as feedback from our international dealers, says Marco Schubert, Member of the Board of Management for Sales and Marketing at AUDI AG. Our nomenclature now provides all customers worldwide with an intuitive orientation in our portfolio. We choose the names of our models in a way that reveals size and positioning at first glance.\nGoing forward, the global alphanumeric model name will consist of one or more letters and a number. The letters A and Q continue to signify the distinction between low-floor and high-floor vehicles. The numbers  currently from one to eight  enable a clear classification independent of the type of powertrain. As a result, the previous distinction between different drivetrain technologies according to even and odd model numbers no longer applies.\nThanks to the orientation according to size and positioning, all-electric models can share the same combination of letters and numbers with combustion-engine vehicles. The necessary differentiation between models and variants in the portfolio is done using the body style (e.g. Avant, Sedan, or Sportback) and the  already established  powertrain code (e.g. e-tron, TFSI e, TFSI, or TDI).\nThe first new model to use this nomenclature will be the combustion-engine-equipped Audi A6. It stands for the brands long and successful history in the full-size segment and will be revealed globally on March 4. Thanks to the powertrain code, the A6 Avant TFSI for example, will be clearly differentiated from the all-electric A6 Avant e-tron. No retroactive name changes are planned concerning models already on sale.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/333543/333543-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333543\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "headline": "Shell starts up new facility in UK North Sea, restoring production from the Penguins field",
        "date": "2025-02-04",
        "hour": "12:44:13",
        "link": "https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=333539",
        "article text": "Shell has restarted production at the Penguins field in the UK North Sea with a modern floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) facility (Shell 50%, operator; NEO Energy 50%). The previous export route for this field was via the Brent Charlie platform, which ceased production in 2021 and is being decommissioned.\nPeak production is estimated at around 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) and currently has an estimated discovered recoverable resource volume of approximately 100 million boe. Although primarily oil production, Penguins will also produce enough gas to heat around 700,000 UK homes per year.\nThe new FPSO will have around 30% lower operational emissions compared with Brent Charlie and is expected to extend the life of this important field by up to 20 years.\nToday, the UK relies on imports to meet much of its demand for oil and gas, said Zoë Yujnovich, Shells Integrated Gas and Upstream Director. The Penguins field is a source of the secure domestic energy production people need today, and the FPSO is a demonstration of our investment in competitive projects that create more value with less emissions.\nAlthough oil will be transported by tanker to refineries outside of the UK, these include ones that supply refined products like petrol and diesel back to the UK because of its limited refining capacity.\nNatural gas will be transported through the existing pipeline to the St Fergus gas terminal in the north-east of Scotland, which supplies the UKs national gas network.\nThe redevelopment of the Penguins field has involved drilling additional wells, which are tied back to the new FPSO. The field is in 165 metres (541 feet) of water depth, around 150 miles north-east of the Shetland Islands. Discovered in 1974, the field previously produced oil and gas between 2003 and 2021.\nThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this media release Shell, Shell Group and Group are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words we, us and our are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. Subsidiaries, Shell subsidiaries and Shell companies as used in this media release refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term joint venture, joint operations, joint arrangements, and associates may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term Shell interest is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis media release contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on managements current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing managements expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as aim; ambition; anticipate; believe; commit; commitment; could; estimate; expect; goals; intend; may; milestones; objectives; outlook; plan; probably; project; risks; schedule; seek; should; target; will; would and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this media release, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shells products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this media release are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plcs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available atwww.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html andwww.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this media release and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this media release, 4 February, 2025. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this media release.\nShells Net Carbon Intensity\nAlso, in this media release we may refer to Shells Net Carbon Intensity (NCI), which includes Shells carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shells NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shells Net Carbon Intensity or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.\nShells net-zero emissions target\nShells operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shells operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shells operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.\nForward-looking non-GAAP measures\nThis media release may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as [cash capital expenditure]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plcs consolidated financial statements.\nThe contents of websites referred to in this media release do not form part of this media release.\nWe may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this media release that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC websitewww.sec.gov\n.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333539/333539-1.png)\nWebWireID333539\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

This means we have fulfilled our promise in Spain to offer a 0% alcohol variety in all our key brands: El Águila, Cruzcampo, Heineken®, and Amstel. -Maria Oliveira, Marketing Director at HEINEKEN Spain\nThe future of socialising is undergoing a paradigm shift as the trend towards moderation continues in markets around the world. Young adults are transforming the social drinking landscape, contributing to the rise in non-alcoholic beverages. Research shows that 67% of people are moderating their consumption of alcohol and consuming low- or non- alcoholic alternatives.1\nThis is where we can make a real impact with our products and brands. We aim to empower consumers and make it easier to select the right beverage for the right occasion, everywhere and at any time of the day or night. We are giving consumers more choice with our 0.0 portfolio of beer and cider brands and educating them with clear and transparent information. Non-alcoholic products also play an increasing role in HEINEKENs messaging on responsible consumption and moderation.\nOur global ambition is to always provide consumers with a choice, by offering a 0.0 line extension of our strategic brands in the majority of our markets. We aim to have a zero alcohol option for one strategic brand in the majority of our markets (accounting for 90% of our business by volume) by 2025.\nLeading the way with zero-alcohol in Spain\nIn Spain, beer is consumed in company, with family and friends, and mainly with food. Spanish consumers also look for flavour and quality over alcohol content, which has led Spain to have the highest percentage of alcohol-free beer consumption in relation to total beer in Europe, with more than 13% of per capita consumption2, consolidating itself as worldwide as a leader in this sector. The boom is also supported by a greater search for a healthier and more responsible lifestyle with the varieties with/without and 0.0.\nWith more than 245 zero-alcohol options in our portfolio, HEINEKEN in Spain surpassed its global goal by offering a low and no alcohol option for each of its strategic brands in 2024, including El Águila, Cruzcampo, Heineken®, and Amstel.\nThe recent launch of El Águila Sin Filtrar 0.0, a groundbreaking zero alcohol beer, exemplifies our dedication to innovation and to promoting responsible consumption among Spanish consumers. Its unique recipe, without a filtration process, is testimony to its non-conformist, adventurous and innovative character. More than 3 million bottles were sold following its launch in April and El Águila Sin Filtrar 0.0 was externally recognised as the number one innovator in beer in Spain.3\n1https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2022/leading-the-way-in-no-low-spirits/\n2Cerveceros de España, Socioeconomic Report 2022\n3Kantar data at the end of Q2\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333538/333538-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333538\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Data from the Phase 3 PALOMA-3 study showed non-inferiority to intravenous administration meeting both co-primary pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints, as well as a five-fold reduction in infusion-related reactions and fewer venous thromboembolic events1CHMP has issued a positive opinion for an extension of marketing authorisation for subcutaneous amivantamab dosed every two weeksJanssen-Cilag International NV, a Johnson & Johnson company, announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended an extension of marketing authorisation for a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of RYBREVANT®(amivantamab), in combination with LAZCLUZE®(lazertinib) for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations, and as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations after failure of platinum-based therapy.For these indications, it is recommended that SC amivantamab is administered weekly from Weeks 1 to 4 (total of four doses), then every two weeks starting at Week 5 onwards.1The subcutaneous formulation of amivantamab offers an improved treatment experience for patients, reducing administration time from hours to minutes and substantially lowering rates of infusion-related reactions compared to the currently approved intravenous therapy, said Silvia Novello, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medical Oncology in the Oncology Department at San Luigi Hospital in Orbassano, University of Turin, Italy.* This positive CHMP opinion is a welcome milestone in the treatment of EGFR-mutated NSCLC, with the ability to make a meaningful difference in clinical practice and provide patients with more time to spend with their loved ones and to focus on what matters most to them.The CHMP positive opinion is supported by positive results from the Phase 3 PALOMA-3 study (NCT05388669), which evaluated non-inferiority of pharmacokinetics (PK) in addition to efficacy and safety of SC amivantamab (administered via manual injection) compared to intravenous (IV) amivantamab (the currently approved route of administration), both in combination with lazertinib, in patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC after progression on osimertinib and platinum-based chemotherapy.1,[2] The study demonstrated that SC amivantamab was non-inferior to IV amivantamab, meeting both co-primary PK endpoints as measured by amivantamab levels in the blood (Ctroughand area under the serum concentration time curve from Cycle 2 day 1 to 15).1At a median follow-up of 7 months, the overall response rate (a secondary endpoint) was 30 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 2437) in the SC arm and 33 percent (95 percent CI, 2639) for IV (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent CI, 0.701.23;P=0.001), meeting the non-inferiority criteria.1Administration time for SC amivantamab was reduced to approximately five minutes compared to around five hours for the first IV amivantamab infusion (across two days) and showed a five-fold reduction in infusion-related reactions (IRRs).1These results were featured as an oral presentation at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and published in theJournal of Clinical Oncology.1,3At Johnson & Johnson, we are committed to optimising every part of the lung cancer treatment journey for patients and healthcare professionals, said Henar Hevia, PhD., Senior Director, EMEA Therapeutic Area Lead, Oncology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. The positive CHMP recommendation for subcutaneous amivantamab takes us one step closer to making this a reality, providing the established efficacy benefits of IV amivantamab with improved safety outcomes and greater convenience for patients.The rate of IRRs for patients treated with SC amivantamab combined with lazertinib was shown to be approximately five-fold lower than that observed with the IV formulation (13 percent vs 66 percent, respectively).1All IRRs were grades 1 and 2, with one patient experiencing a grade 3 IRR in SC arm.1Preventive blood thinning (prophylactic anticoagulation) was used in most patients in the PALOMA-3 study.1Patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation had lower rates of VTE (10 percent) than those without prophylaxis (21 percent).1Furthermore, VTE incidence was numerically lower in the SC arm vs the IV arm (9 percent vs 14 percent) regardless of anticoagulation status.1Severe bleeding risk (grade 3 to 4) was low among patients receiving anticoagulants in the SC (2 percent) and IV (0.6 percent) arms.1Otherwise, the overall safety profile of SC amivantamab is consistent with the known profile of IV administration.1Of the all-grade adverse events that occurred in ≥20 percent of patients, for SC amivantamab compared to IV, the most common were paronychia (54 percent vs 51 percent), hypoalbuminemia (47 percent vs 37 percent) and rash (46 percent vs 43 percent), respectively.1Building on three decades of oncology innovation, Johnson & Johnson has a deep commitment to exploring innovative approaches to meet the urgent needs of patients, said Joshua Bauml, M.D., Vice President, Lung Cancer Disease Area Stronghold Leader, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. We look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients in Europe, as we advance our ambition to transform outcomes in EGFR-mutated NSCLC.About AmivantamabAmivantamab is a fully-human EGFR-MET bispecific antibody that acts by targeting tumours with activating and resistance EGFR mutations and MET mutations and amplifications, and by harnessing the immune system.4,5,6,7The European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorisations for intravenous amivantamab in the following indications:7· In combination with lazertinib for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations.· In combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for the treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations, after failure of prior therapy including an EGFR TKI.· In combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.· As monotherapy for treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, after failure of platinum-based therapy.Subcutaneous amivantamab is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozymes ENHANZE®drug delivery technology.1The CHMP has recommended the use of subcutaneous (SC) amivantamab in combination with lazertinib for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR ex19del or L858R mutations, and for the use of SC amivantamab monotherapy in adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations after failure of platinum-based therapy.[8] The recommended dose regimen for SC amivantamab for these indications is 1600 mg (2240 mg for body weight ≥80kg) administered weekly from Weeks 1 to 4 (total of four doses), then every two weeks starting at Week 5 onwards (Q2W).1When given in combination with lazertinib, it is recommended to administer SC amivantamab any time after lazertinib when given on the same day.7For a full list of adverse events and information on dosage and administration, contraindications and other precautions when using amivantamab, please refer to theSummary of Product Characteristics.7In line with EMA regulations for new medicines, amivantamab is subject to additional monitoring.About LazertinibIn 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc., entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of lazertinib. Lazertinib is an oral, third-generation, brain-penetrant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets both the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing wild-type EGFR.[9] An analysis of the efficacy and safety of lazertinib from the Phase 3 study LASER301 was published inThe Journal of Clinical Oncologyin 2023.9In January 2025, the European Commission (EC) approved a marketing authorisation for lazertinib, in combination with amivantamab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations.10In line with EMA regulations for new medicines, lazertinib is subject to additional monitoring.About PALOMA-3PALOMA-3 (NCT05388669), which enrolled 418 patients, is a randomised, open-label Phase 3 study evaluating the non-inferiority of pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy and safety of subcutaneous amivantamab (administered via manual injection) combined with lazertinib compared to IV amivantamab and lazertinib in patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC after progression on osimertinib and platinum-based chemotherapy.2The co-primary PK endpoints of the study were trough concentration (Ctrough on Cycle [C] 2 Day [D] 1 or C4D1) and C2 area under the curve (AUCD1-D15).2Key secondary endpoints were objective response rate and progression-free survival (PFS).2Overall survival was a predefined exploratory endpoint.1Prophylactic anticoagulation was recommended for the first four months of treatment.1About Non-Small Cell Lung CancerIn Europe, it is estimated that 484,306 people were diagnosed with lung cancer in 2022.11NSCLC accounts for 85 percent of all lung cancer cases.[12] Lung cancer is Europes biggest cancer killer, with more deaths than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined.11The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.12Among the most common driver mutations in NSCLC are alterations in EGFR, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase controlling cell growth and division.12,13EGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15 percent of Western patients with NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology and occur in 40 to 50 percent of Asian patients.14,15,16,17EGFR ex19del or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations are the most common EGFR mutations.18The five-year survival rate for all patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR mutations treated with EGFR TKIs is less than 20 percent and between 25-32 percent of patients receiving the current first-line standard of care, osimertinib, do not survive long enough to reach second-line treatment.19,20,21,22,23,24EGFR exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations are the third most prevalent activating EGFR mutation.25Patients with EGFR ex20ins mutations have a real-world five-year OS of eight percent in the frontline setting, which is worse than patients with EGFR ex19del or L858R mutations, who have a real-world five-year OS of 19 percent.20About Johnson & JohnsonAt Johnson & Johnson, we believe health is everything.

(PK) in addition to efficacy and safety of SC amivantamab (administered via manual injection) compared to intravenous (IV) amivantamab (the currently approved route of administration), both in combination with lazertinib, in patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC after progression on osimertinib and platinum-based chemotherapy.1,[2] The study demonstrated that SC amivantamab was non-inferior to IV amivantamab, meeting both co-primary PK endpoints as measured by amivantamab levels in the blood (Ctroughand area under the serum concentration time curve from Cycle 2 day 1 to 15).1At a median follow-up of 7 months, the overall response rate (a secondary endpoint) was 30 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 2437) in the SC arm and 33 percent (95 percent CI, 2639) for IV (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent CI, 0.701.23;P=0.001), meeting the non-inferiority criteria.1\nAdministration time for SC amivantamab was reduced to approximately five minutes compared to around five hours for the first IV amivantamab infusion (across two days) and showed a five-fold reduction in infusion-related reactions (IRRs).1These results were featured as an oral presentation at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and published in theJournal of Clinical Oncology.1,3\nAt Johnson & Johnson, we are committed to optimising every part of the lung cancer treatment journey for patients and healthcare professionals, said Henar Hevia, PhD., Senior Director, EMEA Therapeutic Area Lead, Oncology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. The positive CHMP recommendation for subcutaneous amivantamab takes us one step closer to making this a reality, providing the established efficacy benefits of IV amivantamab with improved safety outcomes and greater convenience for patients.\nThe rate of IRRs for patients treated with SC amivantamab combined with lazertinib was shown to be approximately five-fold lower than that observed with the IV formulation (13 percent vs 66 percent, respectively).1All IRRs were grades 1 and 2, with one patient experiencing a grade 3 IRR in SC arm.1Preventive blood thinning (prophylactic anticoagulation) was used in most patients in the PALOMA-3 study.1Patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation had lower rates of VTE (10 percent) than those without prophylaxis (21 percent).1Furthermore, VTE incidence was numerically lower in the SC arm vs the IV arm (9 percent vs 14 percent) regardless of anticoagulation status.1Severe bleeding risk (grade 3 to 4) was low among patients receiving anticoagulants in the SC (2 percent) and IV (0.6 percent) arms.1Otherwise, the overall safety profile of SC amivantamab is consistent with the known profile of IV administration.1Of the all-grade adverse events that occurred in ≥20 percent of patients, for SC amivantamab compared to IV, the most common were paronychia (54 percent vs 51 percent), hypoalbuminemia (47 percent vs 37 percent) and rash (46 percent vs 43 percent), respectively.1\nBuilding on three decades of oncology innovation, Johnson & Johnson has a deep commitment to exploring innovative approaches to meet the urgent needs of patients, said Joshua Bauml, M.D., Vice President, Lung Cancer Disease Area Stronghold Leader, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. We look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients in Europe, as we advance our ambition to transform outcomes in EGFR-mutated NSCLC.\nAbout AmivantamabAmivantamab is a fully-human EGFR-MET bispecific antibody that acts by targeting tumours with activating and resistance EGFR mutations and MET mutations and amplifications, and by harnessing the immune system.4,5,6,7\nThe European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorisations for intravenous amivantamab in the following indications:7· In combination with lazertinib for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations.· In combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for the treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations, after failure of prior therapy including an EGFR TKI.· In combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.· As monotherapy for treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, after failure of platinum-based therapy.\nSubcutaneous amivantamab is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozymes ENHANZE®drug delivery technology.1\nThe CHMP has recommended the use of subcutaneous (SC) amivantamab in combination with lazertinib for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR ex19del or L858R mutations, and for the use of SC amivantamab monotherapy in adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations after failure of platinum-based therapy.[8] The recommended dose regimen for SC amivantamab for these indications is 1600 mg (2240 mg for body weight ≥80kg) administered weekly from Weeks 1 to 4 (total of four doses), then every two weeks starting at Week 5 onwards (Q2W).1When given in combination with lazertinib, it is recommended to administer SC amivantamab any time after lazertinib when given on the same day.7\nFor a full list of adverse events and information on dosage and administration, contraindications and other precautions when using amivantamab, please refer to theSummary of Product Characteristics.7In line with EMA regulations for new medicines, amivantamab is subject to additional monitoring.\nAbout LazertinibIn 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc., entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of lazertinib. Lazertinib is an oral, third-generation, brain-penetrant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets both the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing wild-type EGFR.[9] An analysis of the efficacy and safety of lazertinib from the Phase 3 study LASER301 was published inThe Journal of Clinical Oncologyin 2023.9\nIn January 2025, the European Commission (EC) approved a marketing authorisation for lazertinib, in combination with amivantamab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations.10In line with EMA regulations for new medicines, lazertinib is subject to additional monitoring.\nAbout PALOMA-3PALOMA-3 (NCT05388669), which enrolled 418 patients, is a randomised, open-label Phase 3 study evaluating the non-inferiority of pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy and safety of subcutaneous amivantamab (administered via manual injection) combined with lazertinib compared to IV amivantamab and lazertinib in patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC after progression on osimertinib and platinum-based chemotherapy.2The co-primary PK endpoints of the study were trough concentration (Ctrough on Cycle [C] 2 Day [D] 1 or C4D1) and C2 area under the curve (AUCD1-D15).2Key secondary endpoints were objective response rate and progression-free survival (PFS).2Overall survival was a predefined exploratory endpoint.1Prophylactic anticoagulation was recommended for the first four months of treatment.1\nAbout Non-Small Cell Lung CancerIn Europe, it is estimated that 484,306 people were diagnosed with lung cancer in 2022.11NSCLC accounts for 85 percent of all lung cancer cases.[12] Lung cancer is Europes biggest cancer killer, with more deaths than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined.11The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.12Among the most common driver mutations in NSCLC are alterations in EGFR, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase controlling cell growth and division.12,13EGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15 percent of Western patients with NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology and occur in 40 to 50 percent of Asian patients.14,15,16,17EGFR ex19del or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations are the most common EGFR mutations.18The five-year survival rate for all patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR mutations treated with EGFR TKIs is less than 20 percent and between 25-32 percent of patients receiving the current first-line standard of care, osimertinib, do not survive long enough to reach second-line treatment.19,20,21,22,23,24EGFR exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations are the third most prevalent activating EGFR mutation.25Patients with EGFR ex20ins mutations have a real-world five-year OS of eight percent in the frontline setting, which is worse than patients with EGFR ex19del or L858R mutations, who have a real-world five-year OS of 19 percent.20\nAbout Johnson & JohnsonAt Johnson & Johnson, we believe health is everything.

        "article text": "The LEGO Group today announced a DKK 19 million commitment towards four carbon removal projects in partnership with Climate Impact Partners and ClimeFi.\nThe initiatives will support biochar, enhanced rock weathering and reforestation and will deliver carbon removal credits between 2024 and 2026. They will expand the companys portfolio of carbon removal initiatives which includes a partnership with Climeworks direct air capture and storage solution. By building this portfolio, the LEGO Group is developing its understanding of emerging carbon removal and climate mitigation approaches beyond its value chain and how best to support them.\nKIRKBI, the family-owned holding and investment company behind the LEGO® brand, has also made commitments valued at DKK 5 million with the same initiatives.\nAnnette Stube, Chief Sustainability Officer at the LEGO Group, said: \"We are proud to support these climate initiatives which we believe will have a positive impact on the wider environmental ecosystem. Innovative, high-quality carbon removal projects and emerging technologies have the potential to play an important role in supporting a more sustainable future, while reforestation has the potential to support improved biodiversity. These partnerships allow us to build our understanding of new technologies and practices to support a healthy planet for future generations.Engineered Solutions: Biochar and Enhanced Rock WeatheringIn partnership with ClimeFi, the LEGO Group is supporting two biochar initiatives and one enhanced rock weathering solution.\nBiochar carbon removal involves turning waste biomass into biochar, a process which stabilises carbon and stores it long-term. Enhanced rock weathering speeds up the natural process of rock weathering, by spreading rock powder over agricultural fields, permanently removing carbon from the atmosphere. Both solutions have additional benefits beyond carbon sequestration, notably for improving soil health.\nPaolo Piffaretti, Co-Founder and CEO at ClimeFisaid: Were excited to partner with the LEGO Group on this robust and durable carbon removal portfolio.\nThe projects were carefully chosen based on ClimeFis strict quality standards and underwent thorough technical review. The LEGO Groups early adoption of these high-quality carbon removal solutions will help catalyse the growth of the Carbon Dioxide Removal industry and help achieve our shared climate goals.\nNature-Based Solutions: Reforestation in Lower Mississippi Alluvial ValleyThe LEGO Group has partnered with Climate Impact Partners in support of the large-scale reforestation project in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (USA) through the purchase of carbon credits.\nThe project is being developed and managed by the GreenTrees platform and aims to reforest more than 400,000 hectares (one million acres), in a region that has experienced significant deforestation. Reforestation aims to enhance biodiversity, restore ecosystems and remove carbon from the atmosphere. The project also aims to enhance flood protection, protecting against hurricanes and flood damage, and improve water quality in the Mississippi River by reducing nutrient run-off.\nSheri Hickok, CEO, Climate Impact Partners, said: We are proud to partner with the LEGO Group on its climate action ambitions, helping to turn them to tangible impact. This is a leading example of how the private sector can drive real impact  taking steps to reduce value chain emissions and simultaneously channelling finance to solutions, like reforestation, that deliver beyond value chain impact.\nA holistic approach to sustainabilityThe LEGO Group remains dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions within its value chain, focused on minimising the carbon footprint at every stage. The companys efforts to explore solutions outside its value chain, align with its goal to support the global transition to net zero.\nNotes\nPHOTO CREDIT: LITHOS CARBONROCK POWDER BEING SPREAD ON AGRICULTURAL FIELDS, PART OF THE ENHANCED ROCK WEATHERING PROCESS\nThe carbon credits will all be certified by globally recognised standards and have been assessed against the LEGO Groups quality criteria to ensure the projects social and environmental integrity and alignment with long-term sustainability goals. The LEGO Groups due diligence of the projects was supported by Climate Impact Partners, ClimeFi and a leading sustainability consulting firm.\nFor more information, please contactmedia@lego.com.\nAbout ClimeFiClimeFi is a leading global portfolio manager specialising in permanent CDR assets.

        "article text": "The five new helicopters are type AW189 aircraft, which are part of a new generation of helicopters that will be operating on the NCS.\nMore helicopter types on the NCS\nLast year, Equinor signed agreements to procure 15 new helicopters, aimed at reducing reliance on the single model currently in use. In addition to the five helicopters from Leonardo, Bell will deliver 10 Bell 525 helicopters starting from 2026\nThe safety of our employees who travel by helicopter is our utmost priority. New helicopters will make helicopter traffic more robust. Safe, predictable and efficient transportation is crucial to safely maintain a high activity level on the NCS for many years to come, says Ørjan Kvelvane, Equinors senior vice president Operation and Maintenance in Exploration & Production Norway (EPN).\nExtensive experience\nThe contract with Norwegian company Lufttransport is the first operator agreement after the new helicopters were ordered, also for the purpose of supplementing the current Sikorsky S-92.\nLufttransport has extensive experience in dealing with challenging Norwegian conditions, their safety record is good and both the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority and Equinor have deemed the company qualified to carry out offshore flights. The company will also conduct search and rescue operations for Equinor starting in early 2026, under a contract awarded one year ago.\nNewer, tried and true type of helicopter\nLufttransport is the operator with most experience with Leonardo helicopters in Norway, which is an advantage as we introduce these new helicopters, Kvelvane says.\nThe AW189 helicopters from Leonardo represent a newer type of helicopter with thoroughly tested technology and excellent safety. This particular helicopter type is used throughout the offshore industry worldwide. The AW189 also features good passenger comfort, noise reduction and lower emissions, in addition to good support systems for the pilots.\nThe two first helicopters will arrive in Norway in spring 2025, and will gradually commence operations over the course of the summer and autumn. The remaining three helicopters will be delivered and put to use in 2026.\nAssuming ownership\nEquinor has also entered into an agreement with Milestone Aviation Group, the global leader in helicopter leasing. The company will assume ownership of the AW189 helicopters when they are handed over by Leonardo.\nThrough this agreement, weve secured long-term rights to manage these helicopters ourselves, and the contract with Lufttransport gives us a third operator for shuttle services on the NCS, alongside CHC and Bristow. Weve managed to put a set of innovative agreements in place to ensure that we have good technical solutions that provide more robust operations, says Mette Ottøy, Equinors senior vice president supply chain management.\nThe fixed agreement with Lufttransport has a duration of around seven years, with options totalling six years. The total value of the contract, including options, is estimated at around seven billion Norwegian kroner.\nThe agreement with Milestone has an estimated total value of just over two billion Norwegian kroner for a contract duration of up to 20 years.\nUnion involvement\nThe trade unions in Equinor, including the safety delegate service, have been involved in the process and take a positive view of the helicopter type that has been selected. They made the following joint statement:\nThese helicopters have the quality and characteristics that we want on the NCS. These new helicopter types have been developed with focus on safety, improved comfort, less noise and less vibration.\nFacts\nWho is allowed to conduct helicopter assignments on the NCS?\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/333523/333523-1.png)\nWebWireID333523\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Here in Earths northern hemisphere, the days are slowly getting longer, bringing with them the promise of an end to winter. While we are anticipating the return of warmer temperatures, just over 100 million kilometers (more than 62 million miles) away, Curiosity is starting to feel the bite of the colder season.\nOne of the quirks of Mars orbital configuration is that aphelion (when Mars is farthest from the Sun) occurs about a month and a half before the southern winter solstice. This means that winters in the southern hemisphere (where Curiosity is located) are both longer and colder than those in the northern hemisphere. Consequently, we need to spend more of our power on keeping the rover warm, limiting the time that can be spent doing science.\nTodays plan was fairly constrained by the available power, so our various instrument and science teams had to carefully coordinate their requests to ensure that we stay within the power limits that have been budgeted out over the next several plans. Our team is never one to back down from a challenge, so this plan squeezes as much science as possible out of every watt-hour of power we were given.\nOur drive from Wednesdays plan completed successfully (quite an accomplishment in the current terrain!). One of our wheels ended up perched a few centimetres up on a rock, so we arent able to use APXS or DRT today, but we were still able to unstow the arm to take some MAHLI images.\nThis plan kicks off with a pair of ChemCam and Mastcam coordinated activities. The first of these two focuses on some interesting polygonal fractures that we ended up parked in front of (see the image above). ChemCam will use its LIBS laser on these fractures before they are imaged by Mastcam. ChemCam will then use its RMI camera to take a mosaic of some features on the crater floor way off in the distance, which Mastcam will also image. Mastcam then goes it alone, with images of Vivian Creek (some sedimentary layers in todays contact science target), Dawn Mine (a potential meteorite), and a trough off of the rovers right side. The Environmental Science (ENV) team will continue their monitoring of the environment with a Mastcam tau to measure dust in the atmosphere as well as Navcam cloud and dust devil movies. After a short nap, the arm is unstopped to take a number of MAHLI images of Coldwater Canyon, over a range of distances between 5 and 25 centimeters away (about 2-10 inches).\nThe second sol of this plan is largely consumed by ENV activities, including another tau and a Navcam line-of-sight observation to monitor dust. A big chunk of this sols plan is taken up by ChemCam passive observations (not using the LIBS laser) of the atmosphere. This passive sky observation allows us to measure atmospheric aerosol properties and the amount of oxygen and water in the air. Of course, ENV couldnt have all the fun, so this sol also contains a typical ChemCam LIBS observation of Big Dalton with a Mastcam image afterward. After stowing the arm, we will drive off from our current location.\nRight before handing off to Mondays plan, we wrap up with our typical early-morning ENV weekend science time, which includes more tau and line-of-sight dust observations and several Navcam cloud movies. RAD, REMS, and DAN also continue their monitoring of the environment throughout this plan.\nWritten by Conor Hayes, Graduate Student at York University\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/333522/333522-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333522\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "At Moeve, we agree with the widespread industry view that SAF is the only immediate solution for achieving more sustainable aviation.\nMoeve and Norwegian signed a contract to accelerate the decarbonization of air transport between Spain and the Nordic region by promoting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). As part of the contract, Norwegian used SAF supplied by Moeve for flights from Las Palmas airport in Spain to Nordic countries, primarily Norway and Sweden, as well as Denmark, during the months of November and December of 2024.Moeve produces SAF at its La Rábida Energy Park (Huelva) from used cooking oils. Second-generation biofuels can reduce CO2emissions by up to 90% throughout its entire lifecycle, compared to traditional kerosene.1\nAt Moeve, we agree with the widespread industry view that SAF is the only immediate solution for achieving more sustainable aviation. We are proud to supply SAF on a permanent basis at Spains major airports, and this latest supply contract with Norwegian is a crucial step in reducing CO2emissions across the industry.\nÁlvaro Macarro - Moeves Director of Sustainable Aviation\nAnders Fagernæs, VP of sustainability at Norwegian,said: SAF plays a vital role in reaching our target of 45 percent lower CO2emissions by 2030. Las Palmas is one of our most popular destinations, and as such is a great location to further our work with SAF. We look forward to the collaboration with Moeve and working toward lowering emissions\"To ensure a supply of SAF to its clients, Moeve is building, together with its partners, a new plant with a flexible production capacity of 0.5 million metric tons of SAF and renewable diesel that will form part of the largest second-generation biofuels complex in southern Europe when it begins operation in 2026.With this project, the company is making further progress towards its goal of becoming the top producer of 2G biofuels in Spain and Portugal, with an annual production capacity of 2.5 million metric tons of biofuels by 2030, of which 800,000 metric tons will be from SAF, an amount sufficient for 2,000 flights around the planet.The agreement between Moeve and Norwegian is in line with the European Commissions Fit for 55 package, which includes a legislative initiative called RefuelEU Aviation that aims to boost the supply and demand of aviation biofuels in the European Union, reaching 2% use by 2025, 6% by 2030, and 70% by 2050.In addition, this partnership supports several of the Sustainable Development Goals from the United Nations 2030 Agenda: SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (Climate action).1.Source: According to the European Aviation Environmental Report published by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/333518/333518-1.png)\nWebWireID333518\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "AstraZenecasImfinzi(durvalumab) has been recommended for approval in the European Union (EU) as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy (CRT).\nThe Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) based its positive opinion on the results from theADRIATICPhase III trial, which were published inThe New England Journal of Medicine.\nResults showedImfinzireduced the risk of death by 27% versus placebo (based on an overall survival [OS] hazard ratio [HR] of 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.93; p=0.0104). Estimated median OS was 55.9 months forImfinziversus 33.4 months for placebo. An estimated 57% of patients treated withImfinziwere alive at three years compared to 48% for placebo.\nImfinzialso reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 24% (based on a progression-free survival [PFS] HR of 0.76; 95% CI 0.61-0.95; p=0.0161) versus placebo. Median PFS was 16.6 months forImfinziversus 9.2 months for placebo. An estimated 46% of patients treated withImfinzihad not experienced disease progression at two years compared to 34% for placebo.\nSCLC is a highly aggressive form of lung cancer.1LS-SCLC typically recurs and progresses rapidly, despite initial response to standard-of-care chemotherapy and radiotherapy.2-3The prognosis for LS-SCLC is particularly poor, as only 15-30% of patients will be alive five years after diagnosis.4\nSuresh Senan, PhD, Professor of Clinical Experimental Radiotherapy at the Amsterdam University Medical Centers, The Netherlands, and principal investigator in the trial, said: ADRIATIC was the first Phase III trial in decades to demonstrate a survival benefit in limited-stage small cell lung cancer, reducing the risk of death by 27 per cent in patients treated with durvalumab versus placebo. Todays positive recommendation from the CHMP means that our patients in Europe are one step closer to gaining access to this practice-changing treatment regimen.\nSusan Galbraith, Executive Vice President, Oncology Haematology, R&D, AstraZeneca, said: With 57 per cent of patients still alive at three years in the ADRIATIC trial,Imfinzihas the potential to transform treatment for people with limited-stage small cell lung cancer. If approved, these patients will have access to immunotherapy for the first time, redefining expectations of survival outcomes in this setting.\nThe safety profile forImfinziwas generally manageable and consistent with the known profile of this medicine. No new safety signals were observed.\nImfinziis approved in the US and several other countries in this setting based on the ADRIATIC results. Regulatory applications are currently under review in Japan and several other countries in this indication.\nNotes\nSmall cell lung cancerLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.5-6Lung cancer is broadly split into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCLC, with about 15% of cases classified as SCLC.7\nLS-SCLC (Stage I-III) is classified as SCLC that is generally only in one lung or one side of the chest.8LS-SCLC accounts for approximately 30% of SCLC diagnoses, with an estimated 8,000 people treated for LS-SCLC across the five major European countries each year.9-10The prognosis for patients with LS-SCLC remains poor despite curative-intent treatment with standard-of-care concurrent CRT (cCRT).9\nADRIATICThe ADRIATIC trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre global Phase III trial evaluatingImfinzimonotherapy andImfinziplusImjudo(tremelimumab) versus placebo in the treatment of 730 patients with LS-SCLC who had not progressed following cCRT. In the experimental arms, patients were randomised to receive a 1500mg fixed dose ofImfinziwith or withoutImjudo75mg every four weeks for up to four doses/cycles each, followed byImfinzievery four weeks for up to 24 months.\nThe dual primary endpoints were PFS and OS forImfinzimonotherapy versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints included OS and PFS forImfinziplusImjudoversus placebo, safety and quality of life measures. The trial included 164 centres in 19 countries across North and South America, Europe and Asia.\nImfinziImfinzi(durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-L1 protein and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 and CD80 proteins, countering the tumours immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.\nIn addition to its indication in LS-SCLC,Imfinziis the only approved immunotherapy and the global standard of care in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC in patients whose disease has not progressed after CRT. Additionally,Imfinziis approved as a perioperative treatment in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in resectable NSCLC; in combination with chemotherapy (etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin) for the treatment of extensive-stage SCLC; and in combination with a short course ofImjudoand chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC.\nImfinziis also approved in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin) in locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer and in combination withImjudoin unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Imfinziis also approved as a monotherapy in unresectable HCC in Japan and the EU.\nImfinziis also approved in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) followed byImfinzimonotherapy in primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer that is mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) in the US. In the EU,Imfinziplus chemotherapy followed byLynparza(olaparib) andImfinziis approved for patients with mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, andImfinziplus chemotherapy followed byImfinzialone is approved for patients with dMMR disease. In Japan,Imfinziplus chemotherapy followed byImfinzimonotherapy has also been approved as 1st-line treatment in primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, andImfinziplus chemotherapy followed byImfinziandLynparzahas been approved for patients with pMMR disease.\nSince the first approval in May 2017, more than 374,000 patients have been treated withImfinzi. As part of a broad development programme,Imfinziis being tested as a single treatment and in combinations with other anti-cancer treatments for patients with SCLC, NSCLC, bladder cancer, breast cancer, several gastrointestinal and gynaecologic cancers, and other solid tumours.\nAstraZeneca in lung cancerAstraZeneca is working to bring patients with lung cancer closer to cure through the detection and treatment of early-stage disease, while also pushing the boundaries of science to improve outcomes in the resistant and advanced settings. By defining new therapeutic targets and investigating innovative approaches, the Company aims to match medicines to the patients who can benefit most.\nThe Companys comprehensive portfolio includes leading lung cancer medicines and the next wave of innovations, includingTagrisso(osimertinib) andIressa(gefitinib);ImfinziandImjudo;Enhertu(trastuzumab deruxtecan) andDatroway(datopotamab deruxtecan) in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo;Orpathys(savolitinib) in collaboration with HUTCHMED; as well as a pipeline of potential new medicines and combinations across diverse mechanisms of action.\nAstraZeneca is a founding member of the Lung Ambition Alliance, a global coalition working to accelerate innovation and deliver meaningful improvements for people with lung cancer, including and beyond treatment.\nAstraZeneca in immuno-oncology (IO)AstraZeneca is a pioneer in introducing the concept of immunotherapy into dedicated clinical areas of high unmet medical need. The Company has a comprehensive and diverse IO portfolio and pipeline anchored in immunotherapies designed to overcome evasion of the anti-tumour immune response and stimulate the bodys immune system to attack tumours.\nAstraZeneca strives to redefine cancer care and help transform outcomes for patients withImfinzias a monotherapy and in combination withImjudoas well as other novel immunotherapies and modalities. The Company is also investigating next-generation immunotherapies like bispecific antibodies and therapeutics that harness different aspects of immunity to target cancer, including cell therapy and T-cell engagers.\nAstraZeneca is pursuing an innovative clinical strategy to bring IO-based therapies that deliver long-term survival to new settings across a wide range of cancer types. The Company is focused on exploring novel combination approaches to help prevent treatment resistance and drive longer immune responses. With an extensive clinical programme, the Company also champions the use of IO treatment in earlier disease stages, where there is the greatest potential for cure.\nAstraZeneca in oncologyAstraZeneca is leading a revolution in oncology with the ambition to provide cures for cancer in every form, following the science to understand cancer and all its complexities to discover, develop and deliver life-changing medicines to patients.\nThe Companys focus is on some of the most challenging cancers. It is through persistent innovation that AstraZeneca has built one of the most diverse portfolios and pipelines in the industry, with the potential to catalyse changes in the practice of medicine and transform the patient experience.\nAstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer care and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.\nAstraZenecaAstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialisation of prescription medicines in Oncology, Rare Diseases, and BioPharmaceuticals, including Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism, and Respiratory & Immunology.

        "article text": "Almost seven million UK homeowners plan to renovate their homes this year and intend to spend more than £14,000 each on average over the next two years, according to Avivas latestHow We Live report.[1]\nRenovation plans are particularly popular among younger age groups with close to three quarters (73%) of Generation Z (aged 27 and under) and two thirds (65%) of Millennial (aged 28-43) homeowners planning to carry out work.\nThe report reveals that more than one in 10 UK adults live with their parents, and that multigenerational living is one of the factors driving an increase in UK home extensions.\nAmong those homeowners planning renovations, one in five plan to extend the layout of their homes over the next two years. Within this group, a quarter (25%) planning changes attribute their plans to home working practices. This includes fifteen per cent of those who plan to create a home office, while more than one in 10 (13%) want to create space for a business venture or side hustle.\nThe report finds that the reasons for carrying out property renovations vary, depending on region. Homeowners planning changes in the West Midlands place the highest priority on working from home arrangements, with 26 per cent planning to install a home office  11 percentage points higher than the national average.\nIn contrast, renovating homeowners in the capital are most interested in adding more space to their properties, with a quarter (25%) planning to extend the overall size of their property  four percentage points above the national average.\nTwenty-six per cent of London homeowners who intend to renovate also plan to add another bathroom, toilet, or shower room, a nine-point increase compared to the national average of 17%.\nThe report suggests that the need to house relatives is one explanation for Londoners desire to increase space. Twenty-eight per cent of renovators in the capital plan to add more rooms or space to accommodate multigenerational living  a figure that exceeds the national average by 11 per cent.\nMeanwhile, Scottish homeowners are more focused on making their homes beautiful, with three fifths (61%) planning renovations to enhance the appearance of their properties, surpassing the national average by seven percentage points.\nAvivas latest How We Live report reveals that more than one in 10 (11%) UK adults stated that they live with their parents, step-parents or in-laws and that multigenerational living is a significant factor for homeowners seeking to expand their space.\nAs expected, 16 to 24-year-olds are most likely to share a home with their parents (38%). However, so do 16% of 25-44-year-olds, as well as one in 11 (9%) of Generation X (45-54-year-olds).\nThe report also presents evidence that parents are moving in with their children. Almost three in 10 (29%) 25-34-year-olds cite this as the reason for making renovations intended to create space. The research suggests these moves are related to financial circumstances and a desire to live with extended family.\nAcross all age groups, one in five (17%) UK homeowners point to multigenerational living as the reason for plans to increase their amount of space.

        "article text": "The biggest ever survey into Brits grape-buying preferences is underway in order to establish exactly what it is that consumers want.\nThe trial, called Fruitology, is underway in Tesco stores across the UK because there are now hundreds of table grape flavour and texture profiles thanks to advances in natural varietal developments.\nThe ground-breaking trials to establish exactly what British consumers want are being conducted exclusively by Tesco, under the Jaffa® brand, in conjunction with Peterborough-based global fruit importers AMT FRESH, parent company AMFRESH Group, and leading global fruit developers, BLOOMFRESH.*\nIn order to establish shoppers grape preferences Tesco is selling the fruit in clearly labelled packaging by one of three main criteria  tropical flavour, candy flavour and crunchiness.\nEarly feedback from the trials, which are taking place in 220 large format Tesco stores across the UK, has revealed that UK shoppers favour their grapes primarily by crunchy texture, next by tropical flavour and lastly, by candy flavour.\nTesco Fruit Technical Manager James Cackett explains: If you ask anyone how many grape varieties there are, most people are likely to tell you three  red, green and black.\nAnd that was pretty much the case until the turn of the century when fruit breeders began looking at how to naturally improve flavour, crunchiness and sweetness, which is a wholly natural process, to deliver better quality grapes all round.\nNow with the advance in breeding technology we have the possibility to draw from many hundreds of new grape varieties which will allow us to deliver exactly what our customers want, and thats the reason why we have set up these trials.\nThe Fruitology trials allow us to better gauge and understand the attributes our shoppers prefer.\nAMT Fresh, which also supplies Tesco with other fruit and veg, was recently in the news for its work in introducing richer tasting mandarin fruit to the UK.\nRachel Botha, Head of Commercial at AMT Fresh, explained the background to the programme.\nShe said: This project, which we are implementing with Tesco through the Jaffa brand, is the most far-reaching research ever undertaken in the UK to understand British consumers table grape eating preferences, redefining the way they are segmented and marketed.\nWe are working with the worlds foremost fruit breeding companies to supply the grapes that British shoppers want to consistently see on supermarket shelves. Thanks to advances in technology we now have the ability to do just that.\nThe Fruitology project reflects the strengths of our breeding programmes, the commitment of growers eager to explore new possibilities, and Tescos openness to pioneering shopper-focussed initiatives.\nENDS\nNotes:\n*BLOOM FRESH and AMFRESH Integration: BLOOM FRESH, as part of the AMFRESH Group, leads in varietal innovation, and its expertise underpins the Fruitology platform.\n*Implementation Through Jaffa® and AMT FRESH: The Fruitology project is being implemented through the Jaffa® brand, which is managed by AMT FRESH.\nA brief history of table grape popularity in Britain\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333509/333509-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333509\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Viasat, Inc.(NASDAQ: VSAT), a global leader in satellite communications, today announced that Inmarsat Government (dba Viasat) received a Task Order award to provide satellite communications (SATCOM) services under the Proliferated Low Earth Orbit (PLEO) Satellite-Based Services (SBS) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, which wasawarded in 2023to multiple vendors by the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) on behalf of the U.S Space Force and Space Systems Command (SSC) Commercial Satellite Communications Office (CSCO).\nThis is the first Task Order award for Viasat under the 10-year IDIQ contract, which now has an expanded ceiling value of $13 billion. As part of this contract, Viasat aims to provide a suite of fully-managed LEO satellite-based services and capabilities, to include space relay services, supplemented by GEO and NGSO satellites, supporting all domains  space, air, land, maritime and cyber.\nUnder this initial $3.5 million Task Order, Viasat will provide Ku-band LEO services through a partner network to support U.S. government operations in various global locations. As part of this work, Viasat will provide network management support, including real-time data through an online account management tool and offering comprehensive technical support 24/7 to ensure uninterrupted service. A leading satellite services provider and network integrator, Viasat has worked with trusted satellite owners/operators to provide the bandwidth government customers require at a cost-effective price point.\nAs government operations increasingly depend on space-based capabilities from trusted commercial operators for defense and national security missions, it is critical to have resilient communications architectures that include satellites in geostationary (GEO) and non-geostationary orbits (NGSO). The expansion of satcom services in LEO is part of a Department of Defense (DoD) strategy to strengthen resilience for satellite communications, remote sensing and other capabilities by diversifying and integrating the orbits used.\nViasat has a history of delivering integrated SATCOM solutions and service offerings across multiple bands and orbits to address government customers unique requirements. This new Task Order award is a testament to our teams continued commitment and ability to provide diverse, multi-orbit SATCOM solutions with the global reach, scalability, and flexibility to meet the needs of todays global military operations, said Victor Farah, Senior Vice President of Government Services and Solutions at Viasat. We are proud to provide the government with a resilient low latency global LEO service that offers the flexibility to support the needs of combatant commands, other DoD organizations and international coalition partners.Visit Viasatswebsitefor more information about the flexible satellite communications services for government.\n###\nAbout ViasatViasat is a global communications company that believes everyone and everything in the world can be connected.

        "article text": "From the use of frequent flyer programs, moving of flight operations at airport terminals, lounge access, code sharing, coordinated European flight schedule  customers will already be able to see the benefits of the integration, shortly after the Lufthansa Groups concluded participation in ITA Airways. At a press conference in Rome, Carsten Spohr, CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Sandro Pappalardo, Chairman of ITA Airways, and Joerg Eberhart, CEO of ITA Airways, presented the first concrete steps and improvements for customers.\nWith immediate effect, 36 millionMiles & Moremembers can earn and redeem miles on all ITA Airways flights. At the same time, the 2.7 million members of the ITA Airways frequent flyer programVolarecan earn and redeem their points on all flights operated by Lufthansa, SWISS, Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines.\nWith the start of the summer flight scheduleon March 30, 2025, passengers of ITA Airways and Lufthansa Group can enjoy the following benefits:\nUnder one roof in Frankfurt and Munich:Using the same terminal is an essential prerequisite for quick and comfortable transfers at the Lufthansa Groups hubs. With the start of the upcoming summer flight schedule, ITA Airways will move into the Lufthansa Airlines terminals in Frankfurt and Munich  into Terminal 1 in Frankfurt and into Terminal 2 in Munich. This will significantly reduce passengers transfer times. At all other hubs of the group, as well as in Rome-Fiumicino and Milan-Linate, the Lufthansa Group airlines already offer their flights in the same terminal areas as ITA Airways.\nLounge access:Starting 30 March, ITA Airways passengers will also be able to visit and use the approximately 130 lounges of the Lufthansa Group and its partners on their travels. The lounges of ITA Airways will also be open to Lufthansa Group passengers from this date.\nCode sharing:By adding ITA Airways flights to the route networks of Lufthansa Group Airlines, customers will have more choice and greater flexibility. With the start of the summer flight schedule, more than 100 flight connections will initially share their flight numbers and can thus be more easily combined. These code-shares make it possible to combine flights of different airlines in the group into a single booking. Once fully implemented, this code-sharing will give ITA Airways passengers access to over 250 destinations of the Lufthansa Group. For passengers of the Lufthansa Group airlines, the offer will be expanded to include ITA Airways domestic flights to Sicily, Sardinia, Calabria and Puglia. All codeshare connections can be booked from 25 February through all global sales channels, including online and via the Lufthansa Group and ITA Airways apps.\nCoordinated flight schedules between the hubs:The flight connections between the Lufthansa Groups hubs (Frankfurt, Munich, Zurich, Vienna and Brussels) and ITA Airways two main airports (Rome and Milan) are optimized and better distributed throughout the day to offer guests more travel flexibility. Coordinated departure times mean less waiting time for guests and better connections to long-haul destinations.\nChange of airline alliance:In the future, ITA Airways passengers will also be able to take advantage of all the product benefits of the Lufthansa Group. The Italian airlines admission to Star Alliance, the biggest global aviation alliance, is of crucial importance for this. Preparations have already begun. ITA Airways official accession to the Star Alliance is planned for the first half of 2026. Accordingly, ITA Airways already initiated the withdrawal from the SkyTeam alliance.\nThe cooperation between ITA Airways and Lufthansa Cargo is also to be quickly intensified in theairfreight sector. The first joint offers for freight customers will be available on selected routes as early as the upcoming summer.\nCarsten Spohr, CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, says:Now that ITA Airways has become a member of our airline family a few days ago, we want to push ahead with the merger quickly, so that ITA and its passengers, as well as the guests of our other passenger airlines, can quickly benefit from the advantages of an expanded Lufthansa Group. We are also confident that ITA Airways will realize a profit as early as this year. All in all, we are convinced that today, the start of the integration of ITA Airways into the Lufthansa Group, marks the beginning of a joint success story for customers, employees and shareholders of ITA Airways and the Lufthansa Group.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333503/333503-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333503\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Since October 2024, global offce GmbH has been using the AI-supported chat bot solution Conversational AI Suite from Deutsche Telekom. The voice assistance technology is used in hundreds of calls and achieves a high level of satisfaction among customers and franchise partners. Founded in 2008, the company works in telephone, office and secretarial services. With its telephone angels, global office works for more than 1,600 corporate customers in various sectors. The solution must therefore be flexible, scalable and competent in various specialist areas.\nTelekoms Conversational AI Suite enables round-the-clock customer service and the simultaneous answering of any number of calls, that is 100 percent availability without waiting times. And all this with consistent, standardized answer quality. It helps global office and its customers to manage peak times and reduce waiting times by pre-qualifying inquiries and processing simple tasks directly. In addition, as a listener, it automatically provides employees with contextual information based on FAQs from the respective companies. This relieves the burden on human agents, who can concentrate on more complex tasks. Erik Krömer, Managing Director of global office, explains: We wanted to bring innovation into the company without losing sight of people. After all, human intuition remains irreplaceable in complex matters. For us, the fact that AI supports us is a sign of quality. We are in an extremely dynamic market. If you dont focus on innovation today, you will be left behind the day after tomorrow. It was important to us that the solution is reliable, durable and made in Germany.\nThe scalable, cloud-based platform was developed in Germany with Deutsche Telekom partners and meets all European data protection and security standards, including audits by independent bodies. It provides AI solutions for customer contact via voice channels, email, messenger or web chat. Users create the steps to resolve the callers request themselves using configurable modules on a low-code interface: no IT programming skills are required. global office is planning a self-service portal so that partners can adapt and maintain parts of the suite themselves. The solution combines natural language processing, machine learning and generative AI to process both simple routine inquiries and more complex requests. With its modular structure, the Conversational AI Suite can be integrated into existing environments and connected to third-party systems such as ERP and CRM.\nThe suite offers extensive statistics to monitor and improve the performance and quality of the digital assistants. For example, keywords can be added to better recognize caller intents. Companies take a small risk when introducing the digital agent: they can use special traffic management programs to direct a certain proportion of calls to the voice assistant, check acceptance and make optimizations. If the usability is right and the caller feels well served in their request, the use of AI chatbots will increase. Many companies are still reluctant to use AI, says Klaus Werner, Director Business Customers Telekom Deutschland. Telekom sees itself as a partner in digitalization. global office is a positive example of successful integration.\nTelekom set up the platform for global office and offered support in operating the tools, creating the dialog sequences and integrating it into backend systems. A team from Telekom Deutschlands Solution Business Unit, led by Stefan Marienfeld, provided operational support for the launch together with the IT department at global office. The company opted for a step-by-step approach, starting with simple use cases and gradually expanding. This enables rapid implementation and adaptation to the specific needs of global offices very different customers.\nglobal office GmbH is a leading premium provider of communication and availability solutions for companies. With its telephone angels, the company offers a broad portfolio that includes classic telephony and innovative digital communication channels such as voicebots. It supports companies and public authorities in optimizing their customer interactions and increasing efficiency.\nAbout Deutsche Telekom:Deutsche Telekom at a glance\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333500/333500-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333500\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "From crafting complex code to revolutionizing the hiring process, generative artificial intelligence is reshaping industries faster than ever before  pushing the boundaries of creativity, productivity, and collaboration across countless domains.\nEnter theMIT Generative AI Impact Consortium, a collaboration between industry leaders and MITs top minds. As MIT President Sally Kornbluth highlighted last year, the Institute is poised to address the societal impacts of generative AI through bold collaborations. Building on this momentum and established through MITsGenerative AI Weekandimpact papers, the consortium aims to harness AIs transformative power for societal good, tackling challenges before they shape the future in unintended ways.\nGenerative AI and large language models [LLMs] are reshaping everything, with applications stretching across diverse sectors, says Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of the School of Engineering and MITs chief innovation and strategy officer, who leads the consortium. As we push forward with newer and more efficient models, MIT is committed to guiding their development and impact on the world.\nChandrakasan adds that the consortiums vision is rooted in MITs core mission. I am thrilled and honored to help advance one of President Kornbluths strategic priorities around artificial intelligence, he says. This initiative is uniquely MIT  it thrives on breaking down barriers, bringing together disciplines, and partnering with industry to create real, lasting impact. The collaborations ahead are something were truly excited about.\nDeveloping the blueprint for generative AIs next leap\nThe consortium is guided by three pivotal questions, framed by Daniel Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and co-chair of the GenAI Deans oversight group, that go beyond AIs technical capabilities and into its potential to transform industries and lives:\nGenerative AI continues to advance at lightning speed, but its future depends on building a solid foundation. Everybody recognizes that large language models will transform entire industries, but theres no strong foundation yet around design principles, saysTim Kraska, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and co-faculty director of the consortium.\nNow is a perfect time to look at the fundamentals  the building blocks that will make generative AI more effective and safer to use, adds Kraska.\nWhat excites me is that this consortium isnt just academic research for the distant future  were working on problems where our timelines align with industry needs, driving meaningful progress in real time, says Vivek F. Farias, the Patrick J. McGovern (1959) Professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and co-faculty director of the consortium.\nA perfect match of academia and industry\nAt the heart of the Generative AI Impact Consortium are six founding members: Analog Devices, The Coca-Cola Co., OpenAI, Tata Group, SK Telecom, and TWG Global. Together, they will work hand-in-hand with MIT researchers to accelerate breakthroughs and address industry-shaping problems.\nThe consortium taps into MITs expertise, working across schools and disciplines  led by MITs Office of Innovation and Strategy, in collaboration with the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and all five of MITs schools.\nThis initiative is the ideal bridge between academia and industry, says Chandrakasan. With companies spanning diverse sectors, the consortium brings together real-world challenges, data, and expertise. MIT researchers will dive into these problems to develop cutting-edge models and applications into these different domains.\nIndustry partners: Collaborating on AIs evolution\nAt the core of the consortiums mission is collaboration  bringing MIT researchers and industry partners together to unlock generative AIs potential while ensuring its benefits are felt across society.\nAmong the founding members is OpenAI, the creator of the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT.\nThis type of collaboration between academics, practitioners, and labs is key to ensuring that generative AI evolves in ways that meaningfully benefit society, says Anna Makanju, vice president of global impact at OpenAI, adding that OpenAI is eager to work alongside MITs Generative AI Consortium to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and the real-world expertise of diverse industries.\nThe Coca-Cola Co. recognizes an opportunity to leverage AI innovation on a global scale. We see a tremendous opportunity to innovate at the speed of AI and, leveraging The Coca-Cola Companys global footprint, make these cutting-edge solutions accessible to everyone, says Pratik Thakar, global vice president and head of generative AI. Both MIT and The Coca-Cola Company are deeply committed to innovation, while also placing equal emphasis on the legally and ethically responsible development and use of technology.\nFor TWG Global, the consortium offers the ideal environment to share knowledge and drive advancements. The strength of the consortium is its unique combination of industry leaders and academia, which fosters the exchange of valuable lessons, technological advancements, and access to pioneering research, says Drew Cukor, head of data and artificial intelligence transformation. Cukor adds that TWG Global is keen to share its insights and actively engage with leading executives and academics to gain a broader perspective of how others are configuring and adopting AI, which is why we believe in the work of the consortium.\nThe Tata Group views the collaboration as a platform to address some of AIs most pressing challenges. The consortium enables Tata to collaborate, share knowledge, and collectively shape the future of generative AI, particularly in addressing urgent challenges such as ethical considerations, data privacy, and algorithmic biases, says Aparna Ganesh, vice president of Tata Sons Ltd.\nSimilarly, SK Telecom sees its involvement as a launchpad for growth and innovation. Suk-geun (SG) Chung, SK Telecom executive vice president and chief AI global officer, explains, Joining the consortium presents a significant opportunity for SK Telecom to enhance its AI competitiveness in core business areas, including AI agents, AI semiconductors, data centers (AIDC), and physical AI, says Chung. By collaborating with MIT and leveraging the SK AI R&D Center as a technology control tower, we aim to forecast next-generation generative AI technology trends, propose innovative business models, and drive commercialization through academic-industrial collaboration.\nAlan Lee, chief technology officer of Analog Devices (ADI), highlights how the consortium bridges key knowledge gaps for both his company and the industry at large. ADI cant hire a world-leading expert in every single corner case, but the consortium will enable us to access top MIT researchers and get them involved in addressing problems we care about, as we also work together with others in the industry towards common goals, he says.\nThe consortium will host interactive workshops and discussions to identify and prioritize challenges. Its going to be a two-way conversation, with the faculty coming together with industry partners, but also industry partners talking with each other, saysGeorgia Perakis, the John C Head III Dean (Interim) of the MIT Sloan School of Management and professor of operations management, operations research and statistics, who serves alongside Huttenlocher as co-chair of the GenAI Deans oversight group.\nPreparing for the AI-enabled workforce of the future\nWith AI poised to disrupt industries and create new opportunities, one of the consortiums core goals is to guide that change in a way that benefits both businesses and society.\nWhen the first commercial digital computers were introduced [the UNIVACwas deliveredto the U.S. Census Bureau in 1951], people were worried about losing their jobs, says Kraska. And yes, jobs like large-scale, manual data entry clerks and human computers, people tasked with doing manual calculations, largely disappeared over time. But the people impacted by those first computers were trained to do other jobs.\nThe consortium aims to play a key role in preparing the workforce of tomorrow by educating global business leaders and employees on generative AI evolving uses and applications. With the pace of innovation accelerating, leaders face a flood of information and uncertainty.\nWhen it comes to educating leaders about generative AI, its about helping them navigate the complexity of the space right now, because theres so much hype and hundreds of papers published daily, says Kraska. The hard part is understanding which developments could actually have a chance of changing the field and which are just tiny improvements. Theres a kind of FOMO [fear of missing out] for leaders that we can help reduce.\nDefining success: Shared goals for generative AI impact\nSuccess within the initiative is defined by shared progress, open innovation, and mutual growth. Consortium participants recognize, I think, that when I share my ideas with you, and you share your ideas with me, were both fundamentally better off, explains Farias. Progress on generative AI is not zero-sum, so it makes sense for this to be an open-source initiative.\nWhile participants may approach success from different angles, they share a common goal of advancing generative AI for broad societal benefit. There will be many success metrics, says Perakis. Well educate students, who will be networking with companies. Companies will come together and learn from each other. Business leaders will come to MIT and have discussions that will help all of us, not just the leaders themselves.\nFor Analog Devices Alan Lee, success is measured in tangible improvements that drive efficiency and product innovation: For us at ADI, its a better, faster quality of experience for our customers, and that could mean better products. It could mean faster design cycles, faster verification cycles, and faster tuning of equipment that we already have or that were going to develop for the future. But beyond that, we want to help the world be a better, more efficient place.\nGanesh highlights success through the lens of real-world application. Success will also be defined by accelerating AI adoption within Tata companies, generating actionable knowledge that can be applied in real-world scenarios, and delivering significant advantages to our customers and stakeholders, she says.\nGenerative AI is no longer confined to isolated research labs  its driving innovation across industries and disciplines. At MIT, the technology has become a campus-wide priority, connecting researchers, students, and industry leaders to solve complex challenges and uncover new opportunities. Its truly an MIT initiative, says Farias, one thats much larger than any individual or department on campus.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333496/333496-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333496\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

Highlights include significant additions to the museums photography collection, such as Ming SmithsInvisible Man Series(198891), Stephanie SyjucosTotal Transparency Filter(Portrait of N) (2017), and John EdmondssUntitled (Hood)series (2018), all featured in the 2024 exhibitionGoing Dark: The Contemporary Figure at the Edge of Visibility. The museums Photography Council also acquired the video workMoment 2(2023) by Deborah-Joyce Holman, making the Guggenheim the first American museum to acquire the work. In conjunction with the Young Collectors Council, the Photography Council also acquired Nancy BuchanansTwin Corners, 1975. Ahmet Öğüts Monuments of theDisclosed(2022), the first augmented reality work to enter the collection, marks a significant milestone in the museums acquisition of digital and interactive art.\nAdditional acquisitions include Sarah Szes installation Things Caused to Happen (Oculus)(2023) from the exhibitionSarah Sze: Timelapseand Gabriel ChailesCarrito 1 de la Flota del Centro Cultural AmbulanteandCarrito 2 de la Flota del Centro Cultural Ambulante(2024), which were featured in the Guggenheims Latin American Circle performance series LAC Presents that took place this past November. The museum also acquired multiple works by Rashid Johnson, who will be the subject of the forthcoming exhibitionRashid Johnson: A Poem for Deep Thinkers, opening in April 2025.\nNaomi Beckwith, Deputy Director and Jennifer and David Stockman Chief Curator, states: These remarkable additions to our holdings underscore the Guggenheims enduring mission of collecting and preserving the work of a broad range of artists and visionaries who are shaping the art of our time. Each of these works has been intentionally acquired to reflect the Guggenheims commitment to boundary-pushing art. The works sharpen the museums evolving legacy, while maintaining our commitment to the most compelling practices globally.\nThe Guggenheim enhanced its substantial collection of Matthew Barneys work with the addition of the ceramic and polymer sculpturePower Rack Stack(2024). This piece was among several acquired with the continued support of the A4 Arts Foundation. In addition, both the museums Asian Art Circle and International Directors Council supported the acquisition of major works, including Shilpa Guptas Untitled (Spoken Poem in a Bottle) (2018) and Kim Yun ShinsAdd Two Add One, Divide Two Divide One(198788). The museums Middle Eastern Circle facilitated the procurement of Dana AwartanisLet Me Mend Your Broken Bones 1, 2023.\nIn 2024, the Guggenheim continued to be a leader in the practice of joint acquisitions. In collaboration with the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Guggenheim co-acquired Arthur Jafas LOML (52 Walker Version) (2024).\nThe museums deep holdings of Central and South American artists were further enriched with works by Álvaro Barrios, Loriel Beltrán, Ayrson Heráclito, Valentina Liernur, Delcy Morelos, Abel Rodríguez, Aydeé Rodríguez López, Ilana Savdie, and Tadáskía. Renowned artists whose work was added to the collection the first time include Yuji Agematsu, Lubaina Himid, Tiona Nekkia McClodden, Joyce Pensato, Sondra Perry, Madalena Santos Reinbolt, Mary Weatherford, and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye. Furthermore, Carol Boves Field Figures (2008) and Gegos Sin titulo (1962) were acquired in honor of Richard Armstrong, former director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation.\nThese acquisitions were largely funded by the museums acquisition committees, including the International Directors Council, Asian Art Circle, Latin American Circle, Middle Eastern Circle, Photography Council, and Young Collectors Council, to ensure selections embrace a range of geographies, disciplines, timelines, and cultures.\nAbout the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation was established in 1937 and is dedicated to promoting the understanding and appreciation of modern and contemporary art through exhibitions, education programs, research initiatives, and publications. The international constellation of museums includes the Guggenheim New York; Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice; Guggenheim Bilbao; and future Guggenheim Abu Dhabi. An architectural icon and temple of spirit where radical art and architecture meet, the Guggenheim New York is now among a group of eight Frank Lloyd Wright structures in the United States recently designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/333491/333491-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333491\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "With help from AI, scientists discovered a fresh crater made by an impact that shook material as deep as the Red Planets mantle.\nMeteoroids striking Mars produce seismic signals that can reach deeper into the planet than previously known. Thats the finding of a pair of new papers comparing marsquake data collected by NASAs InSight lander with impact craters spotted by the agencys Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO).\nThepapers,publishedon Monday, Feb. 3, in Geophysical Research Letters (GRL), highlight how scientists continue to learn fromInSight, which NASAretired in 2022after a successful extended mission. InSight set the first seismometeron Mars, detecting more than 1,300 marsquakes, which are produced by shaking deep inside the planet (caused by rocks cracking under heat and pressure) and by space rocks striking the surface.\nBy observing how seismic waves from those quakes change as they travel through the planets crust, mantle, and core, scientists get a glimpse into Mars interior, as well as a better understanding of how all rocky worlds form, including Earth and its Moon.\nResearchers have in the past taken images of newimpact cratersand found seismic data that matches the date and location of the craters formation. But the two new studies represent the first time a fresh impact has been correlated with shaking detected in Cerberus Fossae, an especially quake-prone region of Mars that is 1,019 miles (1,640 kilometers) from InSight.\nThe impact crater is 71 feet (21.5 meters) in diameter and much farther from InSight than scientists expected, based on the quakes seismic energy. The Martian crust has unique properties thought to dampen seismic waves produced by impacts, and researchers analysis of the Cerberus Fossae impact led them to conclude that the waves it produced took a more direct route through the planets mantle.\nInSights team will now have to reassess their models of the composition and structure of Mars interior to explain how impact-generated seismic signals can go that deep.\nWe used to think the energy detected from the vast majority of seismic events was stuck traveling within the Martian crust, said InSight team member Constantinos Charalambous of Imperial College London. This finding shows a deeper, faster path  call it a seismic highway  through the mantle, allowing quakes to reach more distant regions of the planet.\nAmachine learning algorithmdeveloped at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California to detect meteoroid impacts on Mars played a key role in discovering the Cerberus Fossae crater. In a matter of hours, the artificial intelligence tool can sift through tens of thousands of black-and-white images captured byMROsContext Camera, detecting the blast zones around craters. The tool selects candidate images for examination by scientists practiced at telling which subtle colorations on Mars deserve more detailed imaging by MROs High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera.\nDone manually, this would be years of work, said InSight team member Valentin Bickel of the University of Bern in Switzerland. Using this tool, we went from tens of thousands of images to just a handful in a matter of days. Its not quite as good as a human, but its super fast.\nBickel and his colleagues searched for craters within roughly 1,864 miles (3,000 kilometers) of InSights location, hoping to find some that formed while the landers seismometer was recording. By comparing before-and-after images from the Context Camera over a range of time, they found 123 fresh craters to cross-reference with InSights data; 49 of those were potential matches with quakes detected by the landers seismometer. Charalambous and other seismologists filtered that pool further to identify the 71-foot Cerberus Fossae impact crater.\nThe more scientists study InSights data, the better they become at distinguishing signals originating inside the planet from those caused by meteoroid strikes. The impact found in Cerberus Fossae will help them further refine how they tell these signals apart.\nWe thought Cerberus Fossae produced lots of high-frequency seismic signals associated with internally generated quakes, but this suggests some of the activity does not originate there and could actually be from impacts instead, Charalambous said.\nThe findings also highlight how researchers are harnessing AI to improve planetary science by making better use of all the data gathered by NASA and ESA (European Space Agency) missions. In addition to studying Martian craters, Bickel has used AI to search for landslides, dust devils, and seasonal dark features that appear on steep slopes, called slope streaks or recurring slope linae. AI tools have been used to find craters and landslides on Earths Moon as well.\nNow we have so many images from the Moon and Mars that the struggle is to process and analyze the data, Bickel said. Weve finally arrived in the big data era of planetary science.\nJPL managed InSight for the agencys Science Mission Directorate. InSight was part of NASAs Discovery Program, managed by the agencys Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built the InSight spacecraft, including its cruise stage and lander, and supported spacecraft operations for the mission.\nA number of European partners, including Frances Centre National dÉtudes Spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), supported the InSight mission. CNES provided the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) instrument to NASA, with the principal investigator at IPGP (Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris). Significant contributions for SEIS came from IPGP; the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany; the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) in Switzerland; Imperial College London and Oxford University in the United Kingdom; and JPL. DLR provided the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) instrument, with significant contributions from the Space Research Center (CBK) of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Astronika in Poland.

        "article text": "Its winter, its cold, and at the weekend that meant one thing: time for the F.A.T. Ice Race in Zell am See. The festival for hot engines on icy ground is something of a motorsport spectacle and has a unique atmosphere: this weekend the Austrian air was crisp, the tension was palpable, and the racing sounds resonated throughout the snowy valley. In the background, the impressive mountain landscape surrounding Zell am See, with its ski resorts and the nearby Großglockner, provided a stunning backdrop.\nThe F.A.T. Ice Race is not just a motorsport event steeped in tradition, celebrating incredible performance, racing and a fun competition for every split second on the ice. It is also a cultural festival full of lifestyle and fashion and a showcase of the global automotive community. Its here that historic and modern motorsport meet, merging as they do with contemporary spirit. Its a gathering for motorsport fans of all ages and a stage for the social media generation  indeed, tradition has rarely seemed so youthful.\nWhen Ferdinand Ferdi Porsche revived the legendary Ice Race in 2019, a spectacular event was added to the Porsche communitys calendar. The aim was to establish a racing event for the new generation, demonstrating how lively, energetic and diverse a younger audience could be when engaging with tradition.\nA key tenet was that it would be open and accessible to private motorsport enthusiasts  and, crucially, that it would feel authentic. \"Its not about the last second, about victory, but about the cultural asset of the car\" says Ferdi Porsche. Its about mountains, vehicles, technical aesthetics, nature, people, and the collective ambiance, the energy that the community celebrates.\nLast weekend, the F.A.T. Ice Race took place for the fifth time in Zell am See, with about 5,500 visitors enthusiastically following the races across various classes as well as the centerpiece of the event: skijoring. The diverse lineup featured interesting, beautiful, historically valuable and often just thoroughly cool cars.\nHot on Ice was the call for the Taycan, with the electric Porsche showing just how capable it is during taxi rides on the snowy track. The sports cars electric architecture and two motors allow for active torque distribution across the axles.\nThe advantage offered by the two completely independently controllable motors on the axles is absolutely priceless. Its like having four accelerator pedals, says the professional pilot. We could confidently navigate some extreme drifting angles in the Taycan.\nThe Porsche Museum also dazzled with treasures from its collection creating spectacular drifts. Among those at the wheel were Ferdinand and Felix Porsche, brand ambassadors Timo Bernhard and Jörg Bergmeister and the ski legend Aksel Lund Svindal.\nBrand ambassador Timo Bernhard piloted the Porsche 911 Carrera 3.2 4x4 Paris-Dakar (953) that won the Paris Dakar Rally in 1984 with René Metge and Dominique Lemoyne. With the car more usually found thriving on sand, Timo impressed the crowd with his fast rounds on ice, equipped with a set of spikes. \"A fabulous event. You can feel that everyone here has the Porsche brand in their hearts. There are lots of like-minded people here and you experience an incredible amount of positive energy\"\nA very special model on display was the Porsche 911 GT3 Rallye, developed by Porsche in 2004 for the Gran Turismo class of the national rally championship organised by the Royal Belgian Automobile Club. Two-time rally world champion Walter Röhrl and former Porsche engineer Roland Kussmaul put together a rally kit for the all-terrain 911. Richard Lietz demonstrated what this development is still capable of today.\nThe Porsche Museum also sent along the Porsche 959 Paris-Dakar, which Metge and Lemoyne drove to victory in the 14,000-kilometre rally from Paris to West Africa in 1986, when they finished ahead of Jacky Ickx and Claude Brasseur in another 959. The third 959 that entered that race  a car that acted as a flying service vehicle driven by project leader Roland Kussmaul and his colleague Wolf-Hendrik Unger  took sixth place.\nA hint of Le Mans also wafted through the Salzburg region last weekend, thanks to an appearance by the 962 Dauer Le Mans GT, which won Porsche its 13th overall victory at the 24-hour race in 1994. The three-litre twin-turbo engine of the 962 C was modified in Weissach and catapulted the 962 Dauer Le Mans GT from a standstill to 200 km/h in 7.3 seconds. Three chassis were built as racing cars, of which two made the journey to La Sarthe.\nThe Porsche 550 Spyder Panamericana was also in Zell am See at the weekend. In the final Carrera Panamericana in 1954, two Porsche 550 Spyders made headlines as drivers Hans Herrmann and Jaroslav Juhan battled over the entire distance of 3,077 km. Herrmann beat Juhan after five days with a lead of just 36 seconds. The Porsches surpassed several more powerful vehicles, finishing third and fourth overall and winning their class.\nSo much history in a fascinating setting: Ferdinand Porsche, who spent his winter and summer holidays in Zell am See in his youth, has given the region a magnificent motorsport event with the F.A.T. Ice Race. \"We always wanted to do something for the next generation. Thats how we started\" explains Ferdinand Porsche. \"Today we saw more than 5,000 car enthusiasts here in good spirits, having fun and in an unbelievably good mood. Our motto this year was Fun over Speed. And thats the atmosphere here. Everyone enjoys the time here at the F.A.T. Ice Race\"\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/333481/333481-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333481\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

Magaly Castillo (Mariela Garriga) is a U.S. Army special agent sent to the Morón de la Frontera base to find out the whereabouts of a missing American soldier who seems to be linked to the hidden business of Colonel Seamus Hoopen (Ben Temple), head of the base area. The lone military policeman, Sergeant Andrew Taylor (Austin Amelio), accompanies Magaly in her investigations and they soon discover that the two investigations are connected and the case is far more complex than they had assumed, involving both Morón residents and American military personnel from the nearby base.\nWHEN NO ONE SEES US was shot in Madrid and several nearby towns, as well as in Morón de la Frontera and at the U.S. military base in the town of Seville.\nAdditional cast includes Abril Montilla, Lucía Jiménez, Numa Paredes, María Alfonsa Rosso, Eloy Azorín, Virginia de Morata, Carlos Beluga, Lorca Prada and Ana María Vivancos.\nAntonio Asensio, Paloma Molina and Salvador Yagüe executive produce for Zeta Studios.

        "article text": "Imagine getting into your car for a commute as usual, only to find that traffic has ground to a complete halt and a simple journey takes not just twice as long, but many times longer than usual.\nMany of us have experienced something like this and cities around the globe invest millions each year to try and prevent it from happening, but sometimes nothing can be done. As was the case when residents of Sapporo, Japan, conclusively experienced the single worst day of traffic, based on total travel times.\nTravel times reached 47 and a half minutes to travel just 10 km. This is more than double the time it would take to complete the same trip in free-flowing conditions, and it was this congested all day rather than just in rush hour, as is usually the case.\nThe data also shows that while some cities such as London and New York can be consistently bad for congestion, other locations can be hit by bad luck occasionally, when a series of factors combine in the worst way to bring traffic to a standstill.\nIt seems as if the weather was at least partly to blame.Weather reportson that day show light snow showers, mist and patches of fog, making conditions on the roads treacherous. Sapporo is no stranger to adverse weather conditions,back in 2022it set records for the amount of snowfall within 24 hours  60 cm fell on the city, which brought cars, bikes, trains and pedestrians to a standstill.\nJanuary is typically a cold month in Sapporo, the time of year that many go skiing and snowboarding in the region. There is even aSnow Festival where artists sculpt and construct intricate works out of snow  which took place a couple of weeks after the notorious bad traffic day in January 2024.\nAs enchanting as this winter wonderland is, roads are prone to icing over at this time of year, and regular snowfall can cause issues for visibility in the Hokkaido city.\nWe may think that something uniquely catastrophic needs to happen on the roads for traffic to grind to a halt  like when a piece ofroadwork machinery broke downon Orwell Bridge in Ipswich, in December 2023. Hanging over the edge and obstructing both lanes of the highway, the bridge was forced to close.\nWithno alternatives, drivers had to crawl their way through narrow country lanes and the town center, neither of which are designed to handle the volume of traffic that bled into them. For most of that day, Ipswich was thevery definition of gridlock. Many hours later, the bridge reopened and many more hours after that traffic finally returned to normal levels. But, as we saw with Sapporo, sometimes all it takes is bad weather.\nThese two cities are the perfect example of how highly strung our road networks can be. Both Sapporo and Ipswich show that everything from bad weather to broken down vehicles can create ripples in traffic flow that wreak havoc when there are no alternatives.\nWhen traffic is running smoothly and flowing freely without hold-ups, drivers can complete a 10 km trip in under 23 minutes. In typical traffic, it takes them 30 minutes and 30 seconds to do the same trip. Sapporo commuters lost 89 hours last year in rush hour traffic.\nSapporo ranks 28th globally, based on travel times, though other cities in Asia are much more frequently congested. Indias Kolkata for instance is ranked second most congested city in the world based on 2024 data, and drivers typically take 34 minutes and 33 seconds to drive a 10 km trip on an average day.\nWith a population of 1.9 million, Sapporo is the fifth-largest city in Japan, and by no means its worst when it comes to usual daily traffic. Journey times are slightly worse in Kyoto, Kumamoto, Fukuoka, Hiroshima and Sendai than they are in Sapporo, though capital city Tokyo with its highly developed public transportation system fares better with its 62nd place in the rankings.\nIn Tokyo, an average driver will spend just 27 minutes and 15 seconds on a 10 km journey across the city. All these cities, apart from Kumamoto, saw driver time in traffic increase or stay the same last year when compared with 2023 data. Kyoto was Japans most congested city last year. Drivers in the city famous for its Buddhist temples lost 95 hours to rush hour traffic congestion in 2023. In Kyoto, that typical 10 km journey takes an average of 33 minutes and 16 seconds.\nConsidering their population density, Japans cities do a good job of managing traffic. This is in part to well optimized infrastructure,heavy taxeson older vehicles andstrict ruleson private vehicle ownership, for example, before buying a car you have to prove that you have a parking space for it within 2 km of your house. But what can the country expect of the future?\nJapan had arecord number of visitorsin 2024, with a tourism surge that meant more than three million tourists visited the country every month. Favorable exchange rates and perceived safety in Japan are factors that have been cited as drivers for the increased number of visitors  and tourism has boosted Japans economy  though the numbers inevitably put pressure on the existing infrastructure, including roads and public transportation networks.\nIn Sapporo, tourism GDP has grown faster than its overall city GDP, highlighting the importance of foreign visitors attracted by events such as the Snow Festival to boost its economy.\nIn line with other parts of Japan, Sapporo has an aging population. Part of the citys 10-year vision includes a strategy for improving public transportation, as there has been a trend in recent years for people to opt for private cars instead of buses or trains, which goes against what has been seen incities like Tokyo.\nHowever, such measures will only go so far to prevent a recurrence of the January 17, deadlock. While the impact of big events such as concerts, sports finals and festivals on city traffic can be mitigated by effective urban planning measures, such as shuttle buses and temporary parking, unpredictable or extreme weather, it seems, still has the power to bring traffic to a standstill.\nFind out how traffic flows in your city\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/333467/333467-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333467\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Bloomberg announced the first trade completed using its U.S. Treasury (UST) Dealer Algos offering which provides buy-side clients with access to wide pools of liquidity usually available only on dealer-to-dealer trading platforms. The first trade was completed between Morgan Stanley and a leading buy-side firm. In addition to Morgan Stanley, UST Dealer Algos are also supported by Citi, JP Morgan and RBC Capital Markets with additional dealers expected to join the offering in 2025.\nBloombergs UST Dealer Algos solution enables clients to access the algo strategies of dealers on Bloombergs Fixed Income Trading (FIT) offering*. Dealer algos offer clients the opportunity to execute larger size trades, at tighter pricing, with a reduced market impact. Bloombergs key interfaces, BLOT -GO- and TSOX -GO- allow clients to monitor execution slices in real time and adjust algo parameters, enabling enhanced trader control. Bloomberg FIT is seamlessly integrated with Bloomberg AIM and Bloomberg TOMS, and clients of these solutions can also benefit from the new offering.\nExpanding our client offering through UST Dealer Algos aligns with the natural evolution of the markets, enabling us to meet client needs by delivering greater efficiency in executing US Treasuries, said Adam Peralta, Head of US Rates E-Trading at Morgan Stanley. We are committed to meeting our clients needs while staying at the forefront of technological developments in the U.S. Treasury markets.\nWe are excited to collaborate with Bloomberg to provide broader access to our new Rates algos. Leveraging our market leading franchise, futures algo capabilities, and deep proprietary liquidity pool, we offer the very best in e-trading tools and execution quality. We look forward to working with our clients to meet the demands of electronic trading in this rapidly changing environment, said Jamie Mortimore Global Head Rates E-Trading at Citi.\nWe are excited to be bringing our market leading UST algo to more clients via the Bloomberg offering, said Tonia Steck, Managing Director, Head of U.S. Institutional Rates and North American FX Sales at RBC Capital Markets. Clients are looking for differentiated ways to access liquidity and our goal is to continue to be a leader in providing electronic solutions to clients across all Macro products.\nBeing first to offer the buy-side with access to dealer algos is part of our ongoing commitment to provide clients with innovative and market leading solutions*. Traders need to move quickly to capitalize on opportunities and maintain their competitive edge, said Derek Kleinbauer, Global Head of Fixed Income and Equity E-Trading at Bloomberg. Our new UST Dealer Algos offering provides clients with an efficient way to access a deeper set of liquidity sources to get trades done quickly with confidence in the price levels, while minimizing information leakage.\nThis follows the recent launch of Bloombergs FitStreams solution for U.S. Treasuries, which allows traders to view and trade on multiple custom, bilateral prices per instrument. Clients can then trade directly with the dealer streaming the best price. Information leakage is minimized as only the selected dealer is sent the request for trade, and there is no reporting to other dealers immediately after the trade takes place. This also significantly limits market impact for the trade counterparties.\nBloomberg Electronic Trading Solutions (ETS) are used by leading financial institutions to trade efficiently in over 175 markets around the world. More than 9000 client firms use Bloomberg ETS to access industry-leading depth and breadth of liquidity across asset classes from over 1,500 dealers globally. Bloomberg ETS provides market participants with comprehensive solutions across the trading lifecycle, including robust price transparency, analytics, automation and execution, powered by Bloombergs high-quality, multi-asset class data and tools.\nAbout BloombergBloomberg is a global leader in business and financial information, delivering trusted data, news, and insights that bring transparency, efficiency, and fairness to markets.

Led by +ATLANTIC CoLAB, a Portuguese non-profit R&D collaborative laboratory, the goal of the project is to create an operational service for public health. GMVs contribution is based on its proven track record in systems integration and the implementation of services.\nThis service will be hosted on DESP (Destination Core Service Platform), a platform managed by the European Space Agency (ESA) as part of the Destination Earth initiatives system. This will be the first time that GMV participates in a data twin project in the Earth Observation (EO) field, marking a historic milestone for the company.\nThe project, called AIR4Health, is a response to the significant increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme temperatures in Portugal and Europe in recent decades. These phenomena have led to high levels of mortality and morbidity while also exacerbating the degradation of air quality, with serious consequences for health and society.\nGMVs job in the project is to automate the acquisition of input sources in order to create the processing chain, integrate the algorithmic modules throughGMV Prodigi, and deploy them in DESP.\nThe main goal of AIR4Health is to create an early warning system combining climate and air quality data. This innovative prototype will be developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary group of scientists who have already demonstrated the potential of new methodologies to dynamically measure health impact.\nThe project will develop two cases to analyze the consequences on health, linking ozone to heat waves and nitrogen dioxide to cold snaps. To do so, AIR4Health will use data from satellites such as ESA-Sentinel-5p and NASAs AURA, as well as other complementary sources.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/333464/333464-1.jpg)\nWebWireID333464\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

Now, to reclaim her stolen genetic identity, Portia must rescue the man who attacked her before someone else finds him first.

And, most chilling of all, are the girls she thought she saved truly dead?For the next five days only (until end of 02/07/2025), you can download the book on Amazon for just 99 cents.

        "article text": "Google has launched \"Ask for Me\" an AI-powered tool designed to contact local businesses on behalf of users, streamlining the process of comparing prices and checking availability. Currently available in the US through Search Labs, the feature initially focuses on nail salons and car mechanics.\nUsers initiate the process through Google Search, providing details about the service required, such as the type of car maintenance or desired nail treatment. The AI then contacts relevant businesses using Googles Duplex technology, enabling natural-sounding conversations. Importantly, every call begins with a clear announcement that it is an automated system acting on a users behalf, addressing potential concerns about automated calls. Responses are relayed to the user via SMS or email within 30 minutes, allowing quick comparison of options.\nBusinesses can opt out of receiving these calls through their Google Business Profile settings, retaining control over customer interactions. Google has also implemented call quotas to prevent businesses from being overwhelmed with requests. Data collected through \"Ask for Me\" may be used to improve the service and handle similar requests more efficiently, contributing to Googles ongoing AI development. The feature is currently experimental and requires enrolment in Search Labs, which involves sharing data with Google for AI model improvement.\nSources:Mashable,The Verge,Search Engine Journal\nAmazon Ads has released Brand+,a new AI-powered tool within its demand-side platform (DSP), designed to simplify brand awareness campaigns for video advertising.

        "article text": "Data released byNielsen Ad IntelandNielsen Consumer & Media Insights (CMI), shows passenger vehicle advertising ranked seventh among the countrys top advertising categories between January  December 2024, with the nations automotive brands investing $124 million collectively into advertising during that time.\nDespite an overall decline in ad spend for the category, key players, such as Toyota, BMW and Nissan, have increased their investment, accounting for 35% of the automotive advertising share  up from 20% a year ago. Nissan has emerged as the standout, leaping from ninth to third in ad spend rankings for the auto sector, more than doubling its advertising investment over the past year.\nNielsen CMI data also showed that the percentage of New Zealanders planning to purchase a new car in the next 12 months rose from 20% in 2023 to 22% in 2024, with interest in hybrid and electric vehicles remaining steady, as 28% of Kiwis indicated they would consider an eco-friendly option for their next car, mirroring figures from the previous year.\nTop 10 NZ automotive advertisers by spend\nThe top advertisers in New Zealands automotive sector over the past year were: 1. Toyota, 2. Kia, 3. Nissan, 4. BMW, 5. Hyundai, 6. Suzuki, 7. Ford, 8. Mazda, 9. Mercedes-Benz, and 10. Volkswagen.\nNielsen Ad Intels Pacific Commercial Lead, Rose Lopreiato, said:The competition in New Zealands automotive advertising space is intensifying, with brands like Nissan significantly ramping up their investment. While the overall category faces challenges, the increased spending by leading players underscores their determination to connect with consumers and adapt to evolving market trends.\nNielsen Commercial Director NZ Agencies & Advertisers, Helene Maurer, added: This growth is particularly significant as Kiwis show renewed interest in new car purchases and a continued focus on more sustainable options, such as hybrid and electric vehicles. As the automotive landscape continues to shift, its essential for advertisers and agencies to have essential insights like these to get the jump on their competition by better understanding how changing advertising and consumer trends are influencing preferences and driving brand loyalty.\nAbout Nielsen\nNielsen is a global leader in audience measurement, data and analytics.

        "article text": "Hellmanns Big Game commercial, When Sally Met Hellmanns, brings together Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan  35 years after the 80s hit rom-com When Harry Met Sally  evoking timeless flavor and nostalgia with the iconic line: Ill have what shes having. Reprising their beloved roles of Harry and Sally, the duo hilariously recreates the films unforgettable deli scene in Katzs Delicatessen, with a deliciously creamy twist, thanks to Hellmanns mayonnaise.\nThe :30 commercial finds Sally sitting across from Harry, wearing his classic cable knit fishermans sweater, celebrating their anniversary over a traditional deli lunch. Sally is displeased with her turkey sandwich until she adds a generous squeeze of rich and creamy Hellmanns mayonnaise that adds mind-blowing flavor so palpable that the rest of the patrons cant help but notice. So much so, award-nominated actress and producer, Sydney Sweeney, takes notice, delivering the famous line, Ill Have What Shes Having.\nReuniting with Billy and stepping back into Sallys shoes was a joy, said Meg Ryan. Im hoping itll be fun for fans to revisit this scene with its (wink, wink) new star, Hellmanns mayo.\nThe opportunity to return to Katzs Deli with Meg was a no brainer, said Billy Crystal. Thanks to Hellmanns, who came up with the concept and wrote a really funny spot, were bringing some laughs and nostalgia and helping When Harry Met Sally celebrate its 35th Anniversary during the Big Game this year.\nThe commercial, created by VML, was shot at the famed Katzs Deli, with Meg and Billy back at the same table where they filmed the original scene, as well as Sydney delivering the famous line from the same table it was delivered at 35 years ago.\nWorking with legends like Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal on this nostalgic and hilarious ad was such an honor. When Harry Met Sally is a rom-com classic, and adding Hellmanns to the scene was a perfect match, so it was an easy yes for this project, said Sydney Sweeney. I cant wait for everyone to see it during the Big Game\"\nTo bring the flavor directly to fans, Hellmanns is teaming up with Katzs Deli to bring the iconic sandwiches featured in the ad to fans across the country. Beginning today through Sunday, February 9, mayo lovers can experience how Hellmanns hits the spot with the official What Shes Having Sandwich Package which features the main ingredients and a recipe card to make Sallys very particular, and very delicious, turkey sandwich order (with Hellmanns mayo of course) along with Harrys pastrami sandwich, just in time for the Big Game.\nFor full details and to order the What Shes Having Sandwich Package, fans nationwide can visitkatzsdelicatessen.com.For the freshest game day spread, fans can schedule delivery on Friday, February 7, to serve at Big Game watch parties and celebrations. Each kit costs $120 (with free shipping) and can feed four to six people. Limited quantities available.\nFor our fifth year in the Big Game, we wanted to be as iconic and memorable as the moments and dishes that are part of the final Game Day of football season. By paying homage to the classic deli moment from When Harry Met Sally, with a creative remake to show fans how the deliciously creamy flavor of Hellmanns can make an ordinary sandwich extraordinarily mind-blowing, we were able to combine humor, nostalgia and the timeless appeal of Hellmanns that will leave a lasting impression on fans just as the movie did 35 years ago.Jessica GrigoriouSVP of Marketing, Condiments, Unilever North America\nThe ad is set to air in the second quarter and will close out Hellmanns season-long winning streak of making game day delicious, from the viral launch of the mayo-inspired Will Levis No.8 fragrance to the humorous Mayotivations campaign and the introduction of Manny Mayo, the brands new, lovable mascot who joined the team earlier this fall. As an essential game day ingredient, Hellmanns continues to make its mark on football culture with engaging campaigns, helping fans savor every play.\nAs part of the brands longstanding commitment to reducing food waste, Hellmanns has partnered with Food Recovery Network for The Big Game in New Orleans to recover and redistribute delicious surplus food for local hunger-fighting partners and people experiencing food insecurity. This same commitment resulted in the redistribution of 97,000 pounds of high-quality, surplus food as part of a year-round partnership with Food Recovery Network in 2024.\nThis is a once in a lifetime reunion of a classic movie duo for a classic brand like Hellmanns, said Susan Golkin, Executive Creative Director, VML, who has been behind Hellmanns Super Bowl creative for the past 3 years. If you are going to show that Hellmanns makes a sandwich better, you may as well start with the best sandwich scene in movie history. And honor it. Same intro, same camera angles, same famous deli.\nBoth the :30 and :60 versions of When Sally Met Hellmanns are available across Hellmanns social media platforms and onYouTube.Agency Credits are shared below.
