        "article text": "AnthologyAI, the leading unified AI platform for compliant consumer intelligence data, today announced the interoperability of its consumer intelligence platform with large language models (LLMs). AnthologyAIs platform sources data across consumer retail spending, geolocation, streaming, travel, ride-sharing, and more  delivered in real-time and at scale. For the first time, LLMs can train on over 45 billion real-time signals and data points, sourced ethically and directly from U.S. consumers.Currently, LLMs rely heavily on outdated, low-quality, and fragmented data, limiting their accuracy and relevance. Real-time data from AnthologyAI bridges this gap, enabling applications powered by LLMs to provide precise, competitive intelligence for enterprise companies and brands.This integration will enable LLMs to answer questions like:\nWhat will be the price of an Uber from JFK to Times Square tomorrow at noon?\nHow did the Los Angeles fires impact Airbnb demand and prices in the surrounding areas?\nHow much did Americans spend on wellness products in the first week of 2025?\nWhat is trending on Netflix for viewers in Miami right now?\nAI models are only as good as the data theyre trained on. The issues with languagefrom data quality to simply running outhave been well documented. What is more of a black box, and a significant differentiator, is understanding behavior, like what people buy and watch. This data has been elusive to LLMs / AI search, and we are excited to introduce it to the market, said John Roa, CEO and founder of AnthologyAI. Weve reimagined whats possible by providing real-time, consent-driven consumer data that not only enhances the accuracy and relevance of LLMs, but also prioritizes transparency and trust. This is the next evolution of data to power AI.Fueled by Ethically-Sourced DataConsumer data has driven multi-trillion dollar industries like retail, advertising, and investment for decades and has been the not-so-secret backbone of tech companies like Meta and Google. However, evolving global privacy regulations and the end of third-party cookies, have made traditional data collection methods increasingly costly and less viable. AnthologyAI addresses these challenges and provides enterprises, including multiple Fortune 100 companies, with a compliant and scalable solution that rewards consumers for their data contributions.Through its proprietary app, Caden, AnthologyAI collects over 100 million real-time data points daily from a diverse, anonymous panel representative of the U.S. population. The platform transforms these data points into multidimensional insights, giving enterprises the competitive intelligence to identify trends, predict behavior, and optimize strategies.To learn more about AnthologyAI, visitanthology.ai.About AnthologyAIFounded in 2021, AnthologyAI provides a platform for ethical, real-time consumer data acquisition, enabling businesses to gain actionable insights into consumer behavior across sectors like retail, media, and travel.

        "article text": "Forests play a crucial role in tourism, attracting many millions of visitors each year and contributing significantly to local economies. They cover over 30% of the global land area, providing endless recreational opportunities. Recognising the value of forests in the development of sustainable tourism, the TUI Care Foundation is expanding its forest projects in Gran Canaria, Zanzibar, and Kenya. These initiatives are part of the Foundations commitment to developing sustainable tourism solutions that benefit both the environment and local communities.\nNear the World Heritage Site of Stone Town, the Masingini Forest National Park is under threat from urban desertification and deforestation. TUI Forest Zanzibar focuses on creating a buffer zone between the urban area and the forest by planting over 63,000 native trees and providing environmental education to young people and the broader community to raise awareness about the forests importance. In collaboration with Kawa Foundation, the project also develops nature-based tourism, including walking and cycling trails, to attract tourists and generate income for the local community.\nIn Kenya, the Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary, an important ecological and tourism area, has suffered from prolonged droughts leading to soil erosion and vegetation loss.TUI Forest Kenya, in partnership with Taita Taveta Wildlife Conservancies Association, plants 40,000 native trees and restores over 24 hectares of forest in a critical riverbank region. The project includes community-run nurseries and a \"leave a green footprint\" campaign, allowing tourists to participate in tree planting and contribute to conservation efforts.\nThe extensive wildfires in 2019 and historical deforestation severely impacted Gran Canarias biodiversity and soil quality. TUI Forest Gran Canaria, in partnership with Fundación Canaria para la Reforestación (FORESTA), aims to recover forest mass with native species. Planting 3,000 trees, the project creates jobs and involves over 700 volunteers in reforestation activities. As part of the project, holidaymakers have already had the opportunity to plant trees to help fight the islands desertification process.\nThe TUI Care Foundations Forest February is a month of activities dedicated to reforestation. Through a series of project launches and educational activities, it emphasises the importance of community-managed reforestation solutions and sustainable agro-forestry tourism practices to safeguard forest ecosystems for local communities and generations to come.\nBuilding on the potential of tourism as a force for good, the TUI Care Foundation supports and initiates projects which create new opportunities and contribute to thriving communities in tourism destinations all over the world. Connecting holidaymakers to good causes, it supports education and training opportunities for young people; drives the protection of natural habitats and the marine environment; and helps local communities to thrive sustainably and benefit from tourism. The TUI Care Foundation builds on strong partnerships with local and international organisations to create meaningful and long-lasting impact. The independent charitable organisation was founded by TUI, one of the worlds leading tourism businesses, and is based in the Netherlands.\nKawa Foundation strives to improve the economic status, reduce poverty and unemployment of Zanzibar Youth, empowering women and improving livelihood in rural communities through capacity building in skills, knowledge and leadership to fill the (skills) gap in the tourism and hospitality industry. All activities of Kawa Foundation focus around ensuring a sustainable future of the heritage and the tourism and hospitality industry by taking action to protect, enhance and make use of the natural, cultural and historical heritage of Zanzibar by creating sustainable income generating activities.\nKawa Foundation encourages partnerships, entrepreneurship, create economic links between the communities and the industry to improve economic resilience and to advocate the implementation of sustainable practices concerning fair working conditions.\nThe Taita Taveta Wildlife Conservancies are a constellation of a total of 33 conservancies located within the Tsavo Conservation Area (TCA) Ecosystem and have formed the Taita Taveta Wildlife Conservancies Association (TTWCA). The TCA is made up of Tsavo East National Park, the Tsavo West National Park, the South Kitui National Reserve, and the Chyulu Hills National Park in south-eastern Kenya, the Mkomazi Game Reserve in north-western Tanzania, and the surrounding group ranches and community lands collectively encompassing approximately 5.8 million acres (23,553km2) of the iconic Tsavo wilderness landscape.\nFORESTA (Fundación Canaria para la Reforestación) is a private non-profit organisation which recovers, maintains and conserves the Canarian forest masses, involving the Canarian society in the knowledge, respect and recovery of the regions exceptional natural heritage. The NGO was established as a 100% private entity with its own decision-making capacity which operates in parallel to the environmental policies of Gran Canaria.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334520/334520-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334520\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "eDreams ODIGEO(hereinafter eDO, the Company or the Group), the worlds leading travel subscription company and one of Europes largest e-commerce firms, announced its results for the quarter and nine months ended 31 December 2024.\nThe Company continued to show strong growth driven by its subscription model. Prime now1boasts over 7 million members after an outstanding performance of +26% in the third quarter, reaching 6.8 million members by the end of December 2024. As guided, the growing customer base and the increasing maturity of existing memberships continue to drive consistent profitability gains. The key profitability metric, Cash EBITDA, reached an all-time high of 123.7 million for the nine-month period, reflecting a 40% increase compared to last year. For Q3, Cash EBITDA grew to 42.6 million, 70% higher than the same period last year, and record achievement for the period. Similarly, eDO continued to expand its cash generation2, which grew 91% to 68.4 million, up from 35.9 million last year.\nWith these excellent results and Q4 being seasonally the strongest, eDO is now set to meet its self-imposed 3.5-year targets by March 2025: 7.25 million Prime subscribers and Cash EBITDA of 180 million.\nRESULTS HIGHLIGHTS\nDana Dunne, CEO of eDreams ODIGEO commented:This has been an exceptional quarter.

This outstanding performance leaves us set to achieve our long-term targets by the end of March 2025. Building on this momentum, and fuelled by our pride to be Prime, were excited to set our sights on our newly issued guidance for the next fiscal year. We will continue to scale our model as we drive further growth across our subscriber base, profitability, and cash generation. As the worlds largest travel subscription platform, our mission is to continue to delight travellers while generating exceptional returns for our shareholders.\nAbout eDreams ODIGEO\neDreams ODIGEO is the worlds leading travel subscription platform and one of the largest e-commerce businesses in Europe. Under its four renowned online travel agency brands  eDreams, GO Voyages, Opodo, Travellink, and the metasearch engine Liligo  it serves more than 21 million customers per year across 44 markets. Listed on the Spanish Stock Market, eDreams ODIGEO works with nearly 700 airlines. The business launched Prime, the first subscription product in the travel sector which has topped over 7 million members since launching in 2017. The brand offers the best quality products in regular flights, low-cost airlines, hotels, dynamic packages, car rental and travel insurance to make travel easier, more accessible, and better value for consumers across the globe.\n(*) GLOSSARY OF TERMS\nReconcilable to GAAP measures\nAdjusted EBITDAmeans operating profit / loss before depreciation and amortisation, impairment and profit / loss on disposals of non-current assets, as well as adjusted items corresponding to certain share-based compensation, restructuring expenses and other income and expense items which are considered by Management to not be reflective of the Groups ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA provides to the reader a better view about the ongoing EBITDA generated by the Group.\nAdjusted Net Incomemeans the IFRS net income less certain share-based compensation, restructuring expenses and other income and expense items which are considered by Management to not be reflective of the Groups ongoing operations. Adjusted Net Income provides to the reader a better view about the ongoing results generated by the Group.\nCash EBITDAmeans Adjusted EBITDA plus the variation of the Prime deferred revenue corresponding to the Prime fees that have been collected and that are pending to be accrued. The Prime fees pending to be accrued are non-refundable and will be booked as revenue based on a gradual method. Cash EBITDA provides to the reader a view of the sum of the ongoing EBITDA and the full Prime fees generated in the period. The Groups main sources of financing (the 2027 Notes and the SSRCF) consider Cash EBITDA as the main measure of results and the source to meet the Groups financial obligations. Additionally, under the SSRCF, the Group is subject to the Adjusted Gross Leverage Financial Covenant (see note 24), that is a Financial Covenant based on Gross Financial Debt divided by Cash EBITDA, further adjusted by certain corrections. See section Reconciliation of APMs, subsection 2.5. Cash EBITDA. Cash EBITDA for Prime refers to the Cash EBITDA of the Prime segment.\nCash Flowmeans(Free) Cash Flow ex Non-Prime Working Capital means Cash EBITDA and adjusted for cash flows from investing activities, tax payments and interest payments (normalised interest payments, excluding one-offs linked to refinancing). The Group believes this measure is useful as it provides a simplified overview of the cash generated by the Group from activities needed to conduct business and mainly before equity / debt issuance and repayments. This measure does not include changes in working capital other than the variation of the Prime deferred liability as management believes it may reflect cash that is temporary and not necessarily associated with core operations.\nCash Marginal Profitmeans Marginal Profit plus the variation of the Prime deferred revenue corresponding to the Prime fees that have been collected and that are pending to be accrued. The Prime fees pending to be accrued are non-refundable and will be booked as revenue based on usage, which refers to each instance the customer uses Prime to make a Booking with a discount, or when the Prime contracted period expires. Cash Marginal Profit provides a measure of the sum of the Marginal Profit and the full Prime fees generated in the period.\nCash Revenue Marginmeans Revenue Margin plus the variation of the Prime deferred revenue corresponding to the Prime fees that have been collected and that are pending to be accrued. The Prime fees pending to be accrued are non-refundable and will be booked as revenue based on gradual method. Cash Revenue Margin provides a measure of the sum of the Revenue Margin and the full Prime fees generated in the period.\nRevenue Marginmeans the IFRS revenue less the cost of supplies. The Groups Management uses Revenue Margin to provide a measure of its revenue after reflecting the deduction of amounts payable to suppliers in connection with the revenue recognition criteria used for products sold under the principal model (gross value basis). Accordingly, Revenue Margin provides a comparable revenue measure for products, whether sold under the agency or principal model. The Group acted under the principal model in regards to the supply of hotel accommodation until September 2022. As of that date, the Group only offers hotel intermediation services, therefore no cost of supply is registered and Revenue and Revenue Margin are of equal amounts. Prime Revenue Margin refers to the Revenue Margin of the Prime segment. Revenue disaggregation has been updated by the Group to better align with the new two levels of reportable segments and how the Leadership Team evaluates the operating performance\nOther Defined Terms\nBookingsrefers to the number of transactions under the agency model and the principal model as well as transactions made under white label arrangements. One Booking can encompass one or more products and one or more passengers. The Group acted under the principal model in regards to the supply of hotel accommodation until September 2022. As of that date, the Group only offers hotel intermediation services, so no cost of sales is recorded and Revenue and Revenue Margin are the same.\nPrime membersmeans the total number of customers that have a Prime subscription in a given period.Prime / Non Prime. The Group presents certain profit and loss measures split by Prime and Non Prime. In this context, Prime means the profit and loss measure generated from Prime users. Non-Prime means the profit and loss measure generated from non-Prime users. For instance, in the case of Prime Cash Revenue Margin, it includes elements such as, but not limited to, the Prime fees collected, GDS incentives, commissions, ancillary services, etc. consumed by Prime clients. As Prime is a yearly program, Prime / Non Prime profit and loss measures are presented on a last twelve months basis.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334518/334518-1.png)\nWebWireID334518\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Since 2022, Mozilla has been in an active processevolving what we do and renewing our leadership. We announced several updates on the leadership piece of this ongoing work.\nWeve recognized that Mozilla faces major headwinds in terms of both financial growth and mission impact. While Firefox remains the core of what we do, we also need to take steps to diversify: investing in privacy-respecting advertising to grow new revenue in the near term; developing trustworthy, open source AI to ensure technical and product relevance in the mid term; and creating online fundraising campaigns that will draw a bigger circle of supporters over the long run. Mozillas impact and survival depend on us simultaneously strengthening Firefox AND finding new sources of revenue AND manifesting our mission in fresh ways. That is why were working hard on all of these fronts.\nWeve also moved aggressively to attract new leadership and talent to Mozilla. This includes major growth in our Boards, with 40% new Board members since we beganour efforts to evolve and grow back in 2022. Weve also been bringing in new executive talent, including a new MoFo Executive Director and a Managing Partner for Mozilla Ventures. By the end of the year, we hope to have new, permanent CEOs for both MoCo andMozilla.ai.\nToday we shared two updates as we continue to push forward with this renewal at the leadership level:\n1. Mozilla Leadership Council:\nWe are creating a Mozilla Leadership Council composed of the top executive from each of Mozillas organizations. This includes: Jane Silber (Mozilla.ai), Laura Chambers (Mozilla Corporation), Mohamed Nanabhay (Mozilla Ventures), Nabiha Syed (Mozilla Foundation), Ryan Sipes (MZLA/Thunderbird) and myself. I will act as chair. The purpose of this group is to better coordinate work across our organizations to make sure that Mozilla is more than the sum of its parts.\n2. New Board Chairs:\nMozilla has built a strong cadre of 16 directors across all of our Boards, bringing an incredible breadth of experience and a commitment to supporting Mozilla in doing the hard and important work ahead. Today we are announcing three new Board chairs:\nEach of these leaders reflects what I believe will be Mozillas secret sauce in our next chapter: a mix of experience bridging business, technology and the public interest. Note that these appointments are now reflectedon our leadership page.\nWith these changes, Mitchell Baker ends her tenure as Chair and a member of MoFo and MoCo boards.In co-founding Mozilla, Mitchell built something truly unique and importanta global community and organization that showed how those with vision can shape the world and the future by building technology that puts the needs of humans and humanity first. We are extremely grateful to Mitchell for everything she has done for Mozilla and we are committed to continuing her legacy of fighting for a better future through better technology. I know these feelings are widely shared across Mozilla we are incredibly appreciative to Mitchell for all that she has done.\nAs I have said many times over the last few years, Mozilla is entering a new chapterone where we need to both defend what is good about the web and steer the technology and business models of the AI era in a better direction. I believe that we have the peopleindeed, we ARE the peopleto do this, and that there are millions around the world ready to help us. I am driven and excited by what lies ahead.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334503/334503-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334503\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

In this system, we are both the students and the teachers of this evolving world.Key Concepts in Dr. Rays Work:The bookDigital Binary +Human Refinery = A Super-Humanis a holistic model for our transhuman acculturation that unites science, religion, heart, mind, and AIs to form a new spiritual intelligence for humanitys future.Human and AI Coexistencespans across five life dimensionsphysical, emotional, mental, spiritual, and universal. AI-Powered Self-Installation: A process by which individuals reprogram themselves for spiritual maturity, intellectual enlightenment, and emotional growth, utilizing the power of AI and allowing us to grow Super-Intelligence in an unbreakable unity together.Dr. Ray emphasizes thatAI is an ally in our evolution, not a threatthe future of humanity lies in co-creating with AI to transcend our current limitations. Dr. Rays work provides both a roadmap and inspiration for those looking to thrive in the Digital Renaissance. Whether you are seeking personal transformation, spiritual growth, or the skills to understand and integrate AI into your life, Dr. Rays books are essential reading.Join Dr. Rimaletta Ray on this extraordinary journey towards a harmonious future whereHuman Intelligence + Digital Intelligence + Transcendent Intelligence = Universal Intelligence.

        "article text": "These initiatives demonstrate HEINEKENs progress in rethinking energy systems and directly reducing emissions at production sites on the path to net zero.\nHEINEKENs ambition is to reach net zero across our value chain by 20401with an intermediate goal to reach net zero carbon in our operations (scope 1 and 2) by 2030.2\nThe HEINEKEN Net Zero Production (NZP) programme is designed to reduce our carbon footprint across nearly 181 production sites worldwide by adopting customised energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions.\nTo reach net zero, we are focused on two key areas:\nWe cannot use a one size fits all approach, and decarbonisation requires precise planning and tailored solutions. We are developing custom strategies for each location which account for geographical, socio-political, technological and economic variations.\nAccess to renewable thermal energy remains a significant challenge. Barriers vary across the globe from fragmented energy infrastructure to gaps in regulation and policy. These obstacles limit available solutions and make some financially unviable. It is too early to determine the impact of such challenges on our ability to achieve our goals. Despite this, we remain steadfast in our ambitions and continue to engage with policymakers to advocate for removing barriers to decarbonisation and explore innovative solutions with our partners.\nThe impact of collaboration\nThe scale of the challenge is significant. Our approach combines in-house expertise with strategic external partnerships. We are collaborating with Siemens, Royal Haskoning DHV, NIRAS, Engie and Arcadis to drive decarbonisation efforts across nearly 181 sites globally. Several local partnerships are already delivering impact.\nEthiopia: After conducting a feasibility study with our global implementation partner NIRAS, we identified a solution to help our Kilinto Brewery tap into renewable electricity available through Ethiopias grid. The solution involves transitioning from traditional oil boilers to electric boilers (e-boilers) as the main source of steam for production. The existing fuel boilers will remain operational as backup in case of grid power outages.\nHungary: We set out in 2022 to create a local decarbonisation roadmap in Hungary with our global partner, Siemens. A feasibility study identified a range of improvements to help drive emissions reductions at our Sopron brewery. After detailed analysis, the measures selected include investment in a high-temperature ammonia heat pump, producing steam using biogas derived from wastewater treatment, and replacing an old tunnel pasteuriser with a hot water-heated unit.Portugal: We began working with Siemens in 2022 to develop a decarbonisation roadmap for our Vialonga site, comprising the brewery and the malting plant. As an example, we will construct an energy recovery system that uses a heat pump to create thermal energy using electricity through a hot water loop. This system will partially replace steam currently produced by natural gas boilers. This part of the roadmap is estimated to reduce of almost Vialongas scope 1 thermal emissions by almost half vs. The 2022 baseline. The brewery is also working with EDP, another major energy company, on a heat battery solution to help deliver renewable steam produced from solar energy.\nA strategic focus on maximising outcomes\nWe take a strategic approach to identifying investments on the path to net zero. Since 2022, we achieved a 34% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions. In 2024, we began to apply a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) to further accelerate delivery while controlling programme costs and prioritising projects. This provides a way of ranking and comparing the expected costs and savings of different opportunities alongside the potential emissions that could be reduced.\nThese initiatives demonstrate HEINEKENs progress in rethinking energy systems and directly reducing emissions at production sites on the path to net zero. Were proud to be working with our technical partners on decarbonisation projects around the world.\nJan-Maarten Geertman, Director Sustainable Production at HEINEKEN\n1Net Zero is defined by SBTi as a minimum of 90% emissions reductions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3. A maximum of 10% residual emissions that cannot be eliminated otherwise must be covered with permanent carbon removal and storage solutions.\n2We have defined this goal as a 90% emissions reductions across Scopes 1 and 2. A maximum of 10% residual emissions that cannot be eliminated otherwise must be covered with permanent carbon removal and storage solutions.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334487/334487-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334487\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Inditex and the University of Barcelona have set up the UB-Inditex Chair of Professional Integration of People with Intellectual Disabilities, with the aim of promoting training programmes for people with intellectual disabilities and fostering research into the social and labour inclusion of this group.\nThe first of these training programmes will start this April and it will run until the end of October. It will specialize in shop operational management skills to facilitate the incorporation of people with disabilities in the fashion industry.\nThe Chair also includes research on competences, barriers and facilitators that influence the training and recruitment of people with disabilities, with the aim of transmitting this knowledge to the social agents responsible for professional integration. It will also address the development of new teaching and inclusion methodologies for this group.\nThe inclusion of people with disabilities in the workplace is a priority in our commitment to people, saidÓscar García Maceiras, CEO of Inditex, at the presentation of the Chair, which took place yesterday in Aula Ramón y Cajal of the UBs Historic Building. Through this collaboration with the UB, we continue to promote their employability and integration, contributing to a more accessible and inclusive environment for all, he added.\nJoan Guàrdia, rector of the UB, welcomed the start of this collaboration between the University and the company: The aim of a public university is to make use of its transformative power. Our classrooms make educated citizens with critical skills who are part of the capital of a country. No one is excluded from this transformative process. It is this transformative capacity that defines our will to remain, and this chair is a good example of it.\nThe president of the UBs Board of Trustees, Joan Corominas, said that this Chair fits perfectly with the objectives of university boards of trustees, and hoped this to be the first step in a long and lasting relationship between university and business.\nThe UB-Inditex Chair is affiliated to the UBs Faculty of Psychology and is led byMaria Carbó, lecturer in the Department of Cognition, Development and Educational Psychology at the centre, who states that this Chair will have a significant impact on the evolution of the social model that has defined intellectual disability throughout history. It will be a determining action to advance towards inclusion and will contribute to the evolution of the models of care for this group in our country, she adds.\nShared values\nBoth the UB and Inditex are strongly committed to diversity and inclusion. Inditex, through its Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and its Incluye programme, based on the supported employment methodology, is promoting the direct incorporation of people with disabilities in its network of stores, logistics, factories and offices around the world, with the aim of doubling the number of people from this group in its teams in two years.\nMoreover, since 2001, Inditex has been promoting For&From, a network of stores designed to foster the social and professional integration of people with disabilities, currently operating in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Mexico. These stores, managed by specialized social organizations, follow a self-sustainable model: after an initial donation from Inditex for their start-up, they operate on the sale of products from previous campaigns at reduced prices, with all the profits going to finance social projects of the collaborating entities.\nOne of the UBs priorities is the promotion of an inclusive and quality university, in accordance with the UNs 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334486/334486-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334486\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "New scientific research led by La Mer and The Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) has been published in the peer-reviewedJournal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology(JCAD) on the efficacy of La MersMacrocystis pyriferaferment containing serum (MPF-Serum) in strengthening skin barrier and accelerating recovery following dermatological procedures. The study, authored by a team of scientists at ELC and distinguished researchers from external institutions, highlights groundbreaking findings in post-procedure skin care.The research, conducted by Dr. Uma Santhanam and Dr. Claude Saliou from ELCs Clinical Sciences team and Dr. Jaime Emmetsberger from La Mers Max Huber Research Labs, along with esteemed dermatologists and clinical researchers, evaluated the impact of MPF-Serum on skin barrier integrity. Across multiple clinical trials involving women aged 31 to 65, the serum demonstrated a significant increase in moisturization and barrier integrity over 8 weeks. In controlled dermatologic procedures, including 70% glycolic acid peels and non-ablative laser treatments, MPF-Serum improved post-procedure recovery better than standard moisturizers. These results suggest that MPF-Serum could be used in preparation for a dermatological procedure and can be an acceptable alternative to conventional ointments, providing a new standard of care during the period of post-procedure recovery.Around the world, ELC is dedicated to cutting-edge science with multidisciplinary expertise ranging from basic science and advanced technologies to the intersections of physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering.

        "article text": "Todays consumers are at the forefront of embracing technologies that offer convenient and personalized experiences. Gen Z, the generation spanning teenagers to those in their mid-twenties, is leading the charge. Instead of juggling between different cards and payment methods, they are looking for an innovative digital solution to manage their payments today and plan for tomorrow. They want their financial life at their fingertips and a simple way of accessing multiple funding options. To meet these needs, Mastercard is launching Mastercard One Credential, a single digitally connected credential with multiple ways to pay.\nIntroducing One Credential\nWith One Credential, consumers will be able to choose the payment option (which may include debit, installments, prepaid and credit) thats best for them, all through a seamless digital experience.\nHeres how it works. Imagine a financially independent consumer in her 20s named Erica. With One Credential, Erica can tailor her payment preferences, so theyre optimized for her household expenses. She can choose to pay for daily expenses under $100, like groceries and fuel, from her checking account; charge expenses over $100 to credit; and pay for the occasional larger purchase via installments. Erica can set her preferences online or in an app, with full control over how each transaction is funded and a holistic view of her spending.\nTodays consumers expect to be in the drivers seat, said Jorn Lambert, chief product officer, Mastercard. Thats what sparked One Credential. It gives people an innovative way to pay thats truly personalized to them. While Gen Z may be leading the way, the desire for personalization spans generations.\nExcitement for One Credential is clear, with key customers and partners already committing to help bring the solution to consumers:\nBendigo and Adelaide Bank groupthat includes Bendigo Bank, Australias most trusted bank and Up, Australias leading digital bank.\nEpisode Six, a leading global provider of enterprise-grade payment processing and ledger infrastructure.\nGalileo Financial Technologies,  a leading financial technology company owned by SoFi Technologies, Inc.\ni2c, Inc., a leading provider of banking and payments technology.\nLithic, a leading financial technology platform known for powering growth businesses with bespoke card solutions and seamless money movement.\nMarqeta, the global modern card issuing platform that enables embedded finance solutions for the worlds innovators.\nWio Bank, One Credential is currently live in the UAE with Wio Bank, a leading digital banking platform.\nGen Z: Digital Natives Who Crave Choice & Control\nCompared to previous generations, Gen Zs payment preferences are distinct in key ways:\nBorn as digital natives, Gen Zs payment appetite is largely digital. According to Mastercards latest research, nearly half1 of Gen Z consumers prefer using new and innovative methods of payment, and 65 percent2 want to manage everything in one place online.\nDespite seeing themselves as financially cautious, Gen Zers tend to spend more than save and are more mindful of their purchases, seeking personalized solutions.3 Compared to other generations globally, personalization is 1.31 times4 more important to Gen Z consumers when choosing a payment method.\nGen Z consumers aspire to build wealth and actively seek out financial education online. In the US, Gen Zers believe they need financial assets totaling more than$9 million,almost double that of Gen Xs goal. To meet their goals, 73 percent5 of teens surveyed say they want more personal finance education and themajorityhave received advice from social media.\nTaken together, these insights show a generation that wants their financial life at their fingertips and is eager to embrace innovative tools as they plan for their futures.\nBridging the Credit Gap\nDespite Gen Zs aspirations and preference for digital wallets6, they have thelowest average credit scoreof all generations in the US, largely a function of thinner credit files and a reluctance to use traditional forms of borrowing. Just half7 of Gen Z consumers currently use credit, the lowest credit usage among all generations. Accessing credit responsibly helps consumers build a positive credit history, which is crucial for future milestones such as renting an apartment, buying a car, or getting a mortgage.\nNearly70 percentGen Zers are actively trying to increase their credit score, butmore than halfdont know where to start. Gen Z needs new digital tools that offer a path to credit worthiness and financial health, while empowering them with choice and control along the way.\nA Stepping Stone to Financial Health\nStructured credit, such as installments, gives consumers another choice in how they pay, and is especially appealing to younger consumers finding a path to credit worthiness. By providing structured credit alongside debit, Gen Z consumers can better manage and control their finances based on their needs.\nA Look Ahead\nFor issuing banks, One Credential provides a differentiated offering that is especially appealing to younger consumers who seek digital, personalized payment experiences and are planning their financial futures. Mastercard also plans to roll out One Credential for small businesses, empowering them with more choice and control over how they pay.\nOne Credential is designed so that consumers and small businesses using it can access even more funding options and set payment preferences around transaction type and time  all with a single, digitally connected credential. To learn more, visit:Mastercard One Credentials homepage.\nOne Credential is Supported by Key Partners Around the World\nBeing first to market with Mastercards One Credential allows us to deliver exactly what our digitally native customers demand - complete payment flexibility and control at their fingertips.

Lauder Curator in Charge, Modern and Contemporary Art, added, Jennie C. Joness fidelity to abstraction invites her viewers to pay attention to the quieter pathways where profound meanings reside. By combining the sensorial experiences of visual art and sound, Jones is one of the most thoughtful and compelling voices in contemporary art today\"This project is the latest in The Mets series of contemporary commissions in which the Museum invites artists to create new works of art, establishing a dialogue between the artists practice, The Met collection, the physical Museum, and The Mets audiences. It stands as the final Roof Garden Commission before the space temporarily closes in preparation for the construction of the Oscar L. Tang and H.M. Agnes Hsu-Tang Wing, The Mets new home for its collection of modern and contemporary art. The series will resume following the anticipated 2030 reopening of the renovated wing, which will feature an expanded Cantor Roof Garden on the fourth floor.About the ArtistIn her paintings, sculptures, works on paper, installations, and audio compositions, Jennie C. Jones uses sound to respond to the legacy of minimalism and to modernism itself. Drawing on her immersion in Black avant-garde music, she deploys sound and listening as important conceptual elements of her practice, from the acoustic fiberglass panels she affixes to canvas that absorb sound to the lines and bars she creates through her compositions that refer to elements of musical notation. Her work across media offers new possibilities for minimalist abstraction, challenging howand by whomit is produced.Her solo exhibitions includeJennie C. Jones: Compilation, at the Contemporary Art Museum Houston (201516);Jennie C. Jones: RPM, at the Glass House (2018);Jennie C. Jones: Constant Structure, at the Arts Club Chicago (2020); and, most recently,Jennie C. Jones: Dynamics, at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (2022). Joness work is held by numerous public and private collections across the United States, including the Art Institute of Chicago; Cleveland Museum of Art; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; The Museum of Modern Art; Philadelphia Museum of Art; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum; the Walker Art Center; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among many others. She lives and works in Hudson, New York.Credits and Related InformationThe Roof Garden Commission: Jennie C.

        "article text": "Five young entrepreneurs have been named as finalists in the latestYoung Entrepreneurs Challenge (YEC), an initiative launched by Verizon and Unloc.\nThe challenge, now in its seventh year, aims to discover the business leaders of tomorrow by tasking young European entrepreneurs between the ages of 16 and 25 to devise a tech-led business idea that addresses a key industry or societal issue.\nThis years challenge has brought to light a number of business models that tackle current sustainability and healthcare challenges including water restoration robots, biodegradable textiles from kombucha by-products, reforestation hexapod robots, a floating solar solution and a robotic glove for stroke rehabilitation. The team received over 100 competitive and innovative business ideas from a wide range of countries across Europe including the UK, Ireland, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Greece, Slovakia, Turkey, Portugal, Austria, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia and Poland.\nThroughout the past seven years, the Young Entrepreneurs Challenge has been a brilliant opportunity to discover young and promising talent across Europe. There is nothing like the imagination and innovation of a young mind. The YEC serves as a platform to help bring their ideas to life, said Sanjiv Gossain, General Manager and Head of EMEA for Verizon Business.\nYoung entrepreneurs in Europe often face hurdles and scepticism in accessing funding and mentorship. Verizon Business is proud to play a small role in helping this next generation of tech leaders stay a step ahead in the industry, as they work to make a positive impact around the world.\nWe are in an era where technological innovation is crucial for tackling complex challenges in sustainability, climate change, and health. Investing in the next generation of leaders and their ideas is essential to addressing these issues, said Hayden Taylor, Co-Founder and Chief Executive of Unloc. Each year, we are amazed by the ingenuity of young entrepreneurs and are impressed to see the innovative ideas submitted for the Young Entrepreneurs Challenge.\nThe five finalists will now compete head-to-head in a grand finale held in March 2025, pitching their business concept live to a panel of expert judges and invited guests representing both the worlds of business and education.\nThe winner receives £10,000 (11,750*), mentorship and a technology support package to help kickstart their business. In addition, the winner will also receive a ticket to attend the Global One Young World 2025 Munich Summit.\nEach runner-up will receive £977 (1175) to fund their start-up business, a personalised development plan that focuses on key priorities, and access to a series of masterclasses over the next year that will pair the finalists with various industry experts.\nAleksandra Daniljuk - AquaRenew\nAleksandra aims to address the global environmental crisis of water pollution caused by excess nitrogen and phosphorus in water bodies. Her solution involves small, solar-powered robots that use wire meshes to collect harmful algae blooms, release oxygen through air stones to combat oxygen depletion, and utilise zeolite biofilters to absorb excess nutrients, thereby preventing further eutrophication.\nThe key selling point is its self-sustaining business model. The collected algae will be sold to businesses that convert them into biofuels and other sustainable products, creating a revenue stream to fund more robots. This approach not only restores aquatic ecosystems but also fosters sustainability and generates economic value.\nAleksandras solution also aligns with the UN SDG 14: Life Below Water, promoting ecological restoration and sustainability.\nLuisanny Martinez - Skomby by Tex\nSkomby by Tex is a solution to modern challenges in fashion and sustainability that offers a sustainable, biodegradable material made from kombucha fermentation by-products. The eco-friendly alternative to traditional leather and textiles is crafted from bacterial cellulose, offering a lightweight, durable, and unique texture.\nThe material is 100% biodegradable and compostable, and can even be reused as planting capsules. To further enhance the sustainable model of the business, the team uses natural dyes like turmeric, spirulina, and saffron, ensuring no toxic chemicals are involved.\nSkomby by Tex collaborates with local kombucha producers in order to reduce waste and emissions. Luisannys long-term vision is to scale production while maintaining low-impact manufacturing practices, such as sun drying and ambient-temperature fermentation.\nMarta Bernardino - Trovador\nThe precision reforestation market is projected to reach $9.77 billion by 2033, growing at a 5.74% CAGR, with high demand from the private sector. Recognising a billion-dollar opportunity, Marta developed Trovador, a reforestation robotics company that combats climate change by planting trees in hard-to-reach areas. Unlike drones, which have a low survival rate for seeds, Trovadors hexapod robots plant saplings with a 90% survival rate. These AI-driven robots navigate challenging terrains like cliffs and slopes, ensuring effective reforestation.\nTrovadors unique hexapod design preserves essential soil conditions for sapling survival and operates autonomously, overcoming obstacles in real-time. This innovative approach supports sustainability by providing rural communities with a safe, efficient reforestation solution, aligning with several UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe service is quite simple and self-explanatory: clients select the planting site, the robot is deployed, and reforestation is monitored remotely. With just £2.5 (3) per tree, Trovador is 30% more affordable than traditional methods, while excelling in speed, safety, and sustainability.\nSebastiaan Schalkwijk - Solar Sub\nSolar Subs floating solar solution revolutionises renewable energy by placing solar panels on water bodies, maximising land use and harnessing natural cooling. This approach enhances system efficiency, increasing energy yield by up to 27% compared to traditional solar systems.\nSolar Subs advanced cooling technology and optimal panel positioning improve efficiency and durability, reducing operational costs and extending the lifespan of solar installations. This innovation sets Solar Sub apart from competitors facing issues with panel overheating and degradation.\nSebastiaan adopts a licensing business model which allows rapid scaling without significant capital investment. This reduces upfront costs and risks, enabling us to focus on strategic partnerships. His model has gained traction with support from key industry players, confirming market interest and feasibility.\nZain Sumdani - Exoheal\nExoheal addresses the global shortage of physiotherapists and the inaccessibility of effective therapy with a robotic glove and a machine-learning-powered app. This solution delivers personalised, real-time therapy, enabling stroke recovery from home. Early trials show a 50% improvement in recovery time compared to traditional methods.\nExoheal app connects patients with hospitals and clinics, allowing remote monitoring and real-time feedback. Its modular design and scalable production ensure affordability and the ability to meet global demand.\nBy 2028, Zain and his team aim to transform 100,000 lives, saving governments $178 million in healthcare costs and enabling $16 million in inpatient earnings.\nFor more information on the Young Entrepreneurs Challenge visit:youngentrepereneurschallenge.com\nAbout Unloc\nUnloc was founded in 2013 by award-winning young leaders and advocates Hayden Taylor and Ben Dowling.

        "article text": "In 2024, Arla Foods experienced a strong year, with revenue increasing to EUR 13.8 billion and strong profit levels enabling the highest dividend payout to farmer-owners in the companys history.\nIn 2024, Arla Groups total revenue reached EUR 13.8 billion and the company achieved a net profit of EUR 401 million. The performance price increased to 50.9 EUR-cent/kg, marking the second-highest level in Arlas history and reflecting strong market demand and effective cost management. As a consequence, Arla proposes a supplementary payment of 2.2 EUR-cent/kg milk delivered, marking the highest dividends paid to the farmer owners in the companys history.\nArlas strong results in 2024 are a testament to the dedication and skill of our farmer owners and employees. Our competitive milk price and financial performance reflect our ability to navigate a complex market landscape effectively and deliver value to our stakeholders. says Jan Toft Nørgaard, Chair of Arla Foods.\nIn 2024, consumers across Europe saw a resurgence in purchasing power and Arla Foods saw a return to branded volume growth, as Arlas strategic brands Arla®, Lurpak®, Puck®, Starbucks and Castello® achieved a volume-driven revenue growth of 3.7%, compared to a decrease of -0.7% in 2023. This rise in brand growth significantly contributed to Arlas high revenue level.\nArlas Fund our Future transformation and efficiency programme exceeded expectations and achieved a net saving of EUR 131 million.\nThe strong financial performance enabled the Arla Board of Directors to propose the companys highest-ever supplementary payment of 2.2 EUR-cent/kg of milk delivered, totaling EUR 292 million. This payment underscores Arlas commitment to delivering value to its farmer owners and exceeds the level set in Arlas Retainment Policy.\nI am delighted that Arla Foods is performing well, and we see a high demand for dairy and our products in particular across the globe. The highest ever supplementary payment, along with a competitive milk price, reflects Arlas financial strength, says Peder Tuborgh, CEO of Arla Foods.\nIn 2024 Arla continued to invest in significant projects to support future operations. Investments reached a record high of more than EUR 1 billion.\nOn track towards 2030 target with climate initiatives\nThis year, Arla consolidated its sustainability efforts under the FarmAhead brand, underscoring a dedicated push towards science-based farming. FarmAhead Technology provides Arlas farmer-owners with essential tools to measure and advance their sustainability transitions. Key components include a climate check with more than 200 data points for every Arla farm, and Arlas incentive model, where farmers are compensated directly in the milk price based on the number of climate actions they implement.\nThe FarmAhead Incentive points collected by farmers have consistently increased, rising from an average of 50 points in 2023 to 53 points in2024.TheFarmAhead Customer Partnership further strengthens these efforts by enabling customers to engage in climate reduction projects on farms, providing valuable data for ESG reporting and scope 3 climate targets. This programme has already secured agreements encompassing over 4 billion kilos of milk.\nIn 2024, Arla made significant strides in reducing emissions, cutting Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 4 percentage points to achieve a 37% reduction from 2015 levels. This progress was mainly driven by energy optimizations, district heating, heat pump investments, and contributions from power purchase agreements.\nWith the support of FarmAhead Technology, Arlas farmer owners continued to reduce carbon emissions in 2024 despite challenges from weather and uncertainties around future legislation. This led to an additional 1 percentage point decrease in scope 3 emissions per kg of milk and whey contributing to an overall reduction of 13% since 2015.\nIn 2024, Arlas absolute emissions related to milk was reduced by 3 % compared to 2023, corresponding to 415 thousand tonnes of CO2e. While reductions were evidently achieved by Arla farmers, a substantial increase in the purchase of external whey for Arlas growing ingredients business led to only a modest decrease in total scope 3-emissions compared to 2023.\nWe remain steadfast in our sustainability journey, and we are on track to meet our ambitious goals. In 2024 we took the lead in sustainability for the dairy industry with our innovative FarmAhead initiatives. Our integrated approach not only reduces emissions but also adds value to our customers and farmer-owners, demonstrating our commitment to shaping a sustainable future, says Peder Tuborgh.\nFood security in an unpredictable world\nThe high levels of geopolitical turbulence from previous years persisted in 2024, with conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East. These crises, in addition to their dire humanitarian impacts, fueled market volatility and uncertainty, disrupted global logistics, and highlighted the vulnerabilities in international supply chains.\nIn an unpredictable world, maintaining food production is paramount, Governments that have not yet prioritized a comprehensive strategy for food security must ensure that its in place going forward. Ensuring robust local food systems is not just a matter of economic stability, but a fundamental responsibility to safeguard our communities in times of uncertainty, says Peder Tuborgh.\nArla is actively contributing to food security and stability within its home markets. In Sweden, Arla is engaged with the food authority consultation group and contribute actively to the ongoing work to strengthen the civil defense. In Finland, where there is a long history of preparing for exceptional circumstances, the dairy industry is a key component of food security. The authorities at the National Emergency Supply Agency coordinate and promote preparedness measures, and Arla, along with other food companies critical to security of supply, participate in activities through the food pool.\nAcross home markets, Arla upholds a significant supply chain responsibility by efficiently processing and utilizing milk from local dairy farmers. This approach secures local employment and ensures the continuous provision of nutritious, high-quality products to consumers. Arlas strategic investments in logistics, infrastructure, and collaboration with farmers and stakeholders are designed to maintain a stable food production and supply chain, even amidst challenges.\nOur cooperative model not only ensures resilience and stability in food supply but also strengthens our capacity to support and feed communities during times of crisis. The fact that we are farmer owned allows for rapid adaptation and innovation during these challenging times, as decision-making is closely linked to those closest to production, says Peder Tuborgh.\nAlso essential is Arla Foods Ingredients, where Arla discovers and delivers ingredients and products that can advance lifelong nutrition for the benefit of consumers around the world. With a specialty in early life nutrition, medical nutrition and health foods, the business is in the midst of a growth journey. This was marked by several strategic changes in 2024, including the acquisition of Volacs Whey Nutrition Business, the largest acquisition in AFI history.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead to 2025, the geopolitical turbulence is expected to persist, and will require careful navigation, leveraging Arlas cooperative strength and local food production capabilities.\nDespite these challenges, consumer purchasing power is anticipated to remain stable in 2025, following improvements in 2024 due to lower inflation and higher wages. However, dairy demand is expected to be influenced by consumer reactions to elevated dairy prices and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties.\nThe global dairy supply, which lagged behind demand in 2024, is anticipated to adjust to the higher price levels, potentially increasing supply in 2025. Nonetheless, political uncertainties, particularly those related to sustainability in core markets, may continue to pose challenges.\nArla projects its 2025 revenue to range between EUR 14.5-15.3 billion, driven by the high dairy price level, with profit share within the target of 2.8% to 3.2%. However, the high price levels, combined with consumer uncertainty, are expected to pressure branded volume-driven revenue growth, projected at -2.0% to -1.0%. This range is subject to the balance of supply and demand dynamics throughout the year. Arla projects efficiencies for 2025 in the range of EUR 90-110 million.\nOur commitment to resilience and adaptability remains unwavering. By harnessing the strength of our cooperative model and focusing on sustainable practices, we are well-positioned to navigate the uncertainties ahead and continue delivering value to our farmer owners and customers, says Peder Tuborgh.\nAdditional information\nAnnual Results 2024 key figures:\n Group revenue: EUR 13.8 billion (2023: 13.7)\n Performance price: 50.9 eurocent/kg (2023: 47.0)\n Milk volume: 13.7 billion kg (2023: 13.9)\n Net profit share of revenue: 2.9% (2023: 2.8%)\n Proposed supplementary payment: 2.2 EUR-cent/kg of milk delivered (2023: 2.1 EUR-cent/kg of milk delivered)\n Net efficiencies: EUR 131 million (2023: 114)\n Leverage: 3.2 (2023: 2.6)\n Overall strategic branded volume driven revenue growth: 3.7% - Includes Lurpak® Arla ® Puck® Castello® Starbucks  (2023: -0.7%)\nSustainability\n Scope 1+2 emissions reduction: 4%P\n Scope 3 emissions reduction: 1%P\n Absolute emissions related to milk reduction: 3%\n Arla consolidated its sustainability efforts under the FarmAhead brand, underscoring a dedicated push towards science-based farming.\nCommercial segments\nArla divides its business into 4 commercial segments.\nEurope:\nIn 2024, Arlas European segment saw a revenue increase of 1.0% to EUR 8,066 million, driven by a 4.1% branded volume growth. This growth was fueled by robust branded positions, strategic growth efforts, and increased consumer purchasing power due to easing inflation and rising wages. Notably, branded volume growth was strong in the Netherlands/Belgium and France cluster (7.4%) and the UK (7.6%).\nKey performers included Arla® Protein, Arla® Pro, and Lurpak®, with respective growth rates of 32.3%, 8.7%, and 6.7%. The successful launch of Arla® Protein in Sweden and Milka® chocolate milk in Germany further boosted growth. The UK business saw a slight decrease by 0.2% to EUR 3,055 million, Arla Sweden increased revenue by 3.6% to EUR 1,592 million, while Denmark saw a revenue decrease of -1.3 % to EUR 1,241 million despite stable branded volumes. Germany experienced a 1.5% revenue increase, supported by strong growth in Arla® Skyr and BUKO®. The Netherlands, Belgium, and France achieved a 4.1% revenue rise, with standout growth from Melkunie Breaker® and Arla® Lactofree. Finland recorded a 2.4% revenue increase, driven by Arla® Protein and successful foodservice initiatives.\nInternational:\nIn 2024, Arlas International segment faced a revenue decrease of 1.5% to EUR 2,435 million, primarily due to unfavorable currency developments in Nigeria and Bangladesh. Despite these challenges, the underlying revenue development was positive, and the segment achieved a branded volume growth of 2.9%.\nIn the Middle East and North Africa, revenues decreased by -2.4% to EUR 970 million, though branded volume growth continued at 2.7%, driven by Puck® and Foodservice growth. The Rest of the World cluster saw a revenue increase of 8.0% to EUR 649 million, with Arla Protein® leading a 6.4% branded volume growth. North America maintained stable revenue at EUR 339 million, with a 2.2% increase in branded volumes.\nSouth East Asias revenue declined by 1.7% to EUR 261 million, but branded volumes grew by 1.7% thanks to strong performance in the Philippines and Indonesia. In China, revenue fell by 20.1% to EUR 121 million due to lower private label volumes, but branded growth was strong at 9.9%, led by Baby&Me. West Africa experienced a substantial revenue decline of 21.5% to EUR 100 million, impacted by currency devaluation in Nigeria and a 19.1% decrease in branded volumes.\nAFI:\nIn 2024, Arla Foods Ingredients (AFI) continued to lead in whey-based ingredients, achieving a revenue increase of 5.4% to EUR 1,015 million. This growth was driven by strong demand for specialized proteins and a notable 2.5% growth in the value-add segment. Despite market price volatility, AFI maintained robust momentum through continuous innovation and concept development.\nA significant milestone in 2024 was AFIs acquisition of full ownership of Volac Whey Nutrition Ltd., enhancing its position in the health and performance nutrition sector. Additionally, the Future 26 strategy saw substantial progress with the completion of new capacities for specialized proteins at Danmark Protein and the commencement of a new permeate dryer in Argentina.\nThe Advanced Nutrition business faced challenges, particularly in China, leading to a strategic shift to focus on ingredients production at the Arinco site, aligning with AFIs core business growth plans.\nGlobal industry sales:\nIn 2024, Global Industry Sales experienced a revenue decline of 0.1%, driven by higher commodity prices amidst strong demand and constrained dairy supply. European and global dairy markets saw significant price increases, particularly in fat-heavy products like butter and yellow cheese, the former rising by 40% during the year.\nDespite a reduction in trading volumes due to lower milk intake from farmer owners and increased retail volumes in Europe and International zones, Global Industry Sales only saw a small decline in revenue. The share of milk solids sold through this segment decreased to 24.8%, reflecting the strategic balance between retail and industry demands.\nGlobal brands:\nIn 2024, Arla experienced a return to branded growth with a volume-driven revenue of 3.7% (-0.7% in 2023) and a branded revenue increase of 3.1% to EUR 6,589 million (2023: EUR 6,375 million), which exceeded expectations at the start of the year. This growth was driven by increased consumer purchasing power, strong sales execution and the strength of Arlas brands, resulting in a rise in the branded volume market share\nArla® brand\nOur Arla® brand with its various successful sub-brands covering multiple categories such as milk, yogurt, cream, powder and cheese, achieved a branded volume driven increase of 3.9% in 2024 (2023: -2.8%). The volume increase was partly offset by a slightly lower price level which resulted in a 3.1% revenue increase to EUR 3,737 million in 2024 (2023: EUR 3,618 million). Some of our sub-brands experienced exceptional volume growth. Arla® Protein grew volumes by 36.0%, and our foodservice brand Arla® Pro experienced a growth of 13.7% during the year. From a market perspective, branded volume growth was especially prominent in the Netherlands/Belgium/France cluster and in the UK with a branded growth of 10.7% and 10.6% respectively in 2024.\nLurpak®\nOur Lurpak® brand achieved a revenue growth of 8.4% to EUR 837 million (2023: EUR 772 million) with volumes increasing by 5.6% compared to 2023 (2023: 0.8%). The strong growth was a result of Lurpak® successfully capitalizing on its brand strength. The European markets led this growth with a volume increase of 6.7%, mainly driven by the UK and Denmark. Our international markets maintained a steady volume growth of 3.7%, mainly driven by West Africa and the Rest of the world cluster.\nCastello®\nOur speciality cheese brand, Castello®, experienced a volume decrease of 1.1% compared to 2023. This was offset due to higher prices leading to a minor revenue decrease of 0.2% to EUR 245 million (2023: EUR 246 million). Our European markets saw a volume decrease of 3.1% which, although a decline, is an improvement versus last year (2023: -4.6%). In our international markets, volumes increased by 0.4%, led by growth in Southeast Asia and Rest of the world. From a category lens the volume growth in 2024 was mainly driven by the cream and processed cheese category, but constrained by decreases in the mould and yellow cheese categories,\nPuck®\nPuck®, our leading brand in MENA, overall grew volumes by 3.4%, with revenue decreasing by -2.7% to EUR 514 million (2023: EUR 526 million). The revenue decrease was mainly driven by the processed cheese category which faced a headwind from pricing competition in key markets. Meanwhile, the cooking portfolio saw a strong growth in both volume and revenue, led by cooking creams and cooking cheese portfolio.\nStarbucks\nOur Starbucks ready-to-drink (RTD) coffee assortment, available in more than 50 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, delivered 0.8% volume growth in 2024. The growth was mainly driven by our European business, which grew volumes by 2.8% due to enhancements in distribution and channel strategies, along with the successful introduction of Ready-To-Drink Protein Coffee in the UK. Our international markets experienced a volume decrease of -3.5% driven by negative impact from the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, however partly offset by strong growth in Rest of the world.\nArla Foods is an international dairy company owned by more than 8,400 farmers from Denmark, Sweden, the UK, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

        "article text": "● The Spanish company LAUDE is the partner selected to develop this use case, which aims to enhance security for individuals protected by restraining orders.● The i2CAT research centre has led the integration, playing a crucial role in connecting operators and ensuring the success of the tests.● The ViRe app is an example of the opportunities offered by the Multi-Telco Innovation Lab, a space to accelerate the adoption of interoperable APIs by developing joint use cases and unifying performance in an accessible and collaborative environment.● The use case will be showcased daily at the GSMA stand (Hall 4, booth 4F30) during MWC Barcelona 2025\nMasOrange, Telefónica, Vodafone Group, and the i2CAT research centre will participate at leading industry show MWC Barcelona 2025 to demonstrate the first use case of the Open Gateway Multi-Telco Innovation Lab,launched last Octoberto offer a developer-ready environment enabling companies and developers to explore and use telco capabilities through standardised APIs. The proof-of-concept (PoC) is a mobile application designed by LAUDE to ensure a consistently safe environment for individuals protected by restraining orders. During the congress, the use case will be demonstrated at the GSMA booth (Hall 4, booth 4F30) daily, 3-6 March 2025.\nThe distinguishing feature of this proof-of-concept is the integration of the Open Gateway APIs, the global telco initiative led by the GSMA that aims to transform telecommunications networks into programmable platforms to deliver network capabilities to everyone under the common framework of CAMARA, an open-source project of the Linux Foundation and TM Forum. In this case, LAUDE has integrated various APIs provided by the Lab, including Device Location Verification, Quality on Demand, Number Verification, Know Your Customer or Device Swap, among others. Additionally, the application employs Artificial Intelligence algorithms powered by the APIs integrated into telco networks, offering enhanced security and reliability compared to other market alternatives.\nLAUDE, a technology company specialising in innovative solutions, software development, and artificial intelligence, is the first to explore the potential of the APIs deployed by the operators within the Lab. The i2CAT research centre, serving as coordinator, has optimised the performance of these APIs to fine-tune their functionality. With its first PoC, the Lab demonstrates its capabilities in a use case that prioritizes addressing critical social needs.\nViRe is a multi-operator mobile application that informs victims in real time of the proximity or risky behaviour of people identified as potentially dangerous, guaranteeing them a safe environment at all times. The application also alerts law enforcement and, optionally, people selected by the victim, such as family, friends or coworkers, offering extra protection to those at risk. It allows victims protected by restraining orders to set safe locations and verify security at public venues regardless of borders, as it is based on standard universal APIs and works across countries. It can also be configured to monitor places related to the victim even if the victim is not physically there, such as their home or workplace.\nVíctor del Pozo, General Director of Innovation, Alliances, and New Services at MasOrange, highlighted: The networks of TelCo supporting Open Gateway solutions will enable us to address real-life issues that impact peoples lives in an immediate, reliable, and practical manner. ViRe is a prime example, as it facilitates instant decision-making to enhance the protection of people protected by restraining orders.\nIrene Bernal, Telefónica Open Gateway Product and Strategy Director, said: We are celebrating this first success story of the laboratory we launched just a few months ago, which shows that the collaboration between several operators together with i2CAT is beginning to bear fruit, and with which we hope to soon be able to unveil many new possibilities for the digital ecosystem.\nFor Beatriz Fernandez, Head of Core, SW & Platforms at Vodafone Group, collaboration among operators is crucial for the API industry to prosper. By working together, we can leverage our collective strengths and resources to create standardised solutions that benefit everyone. This joint demo with ViRe showcases the power of APIs and, also, sets a new standard for how we can address critical societal needs through technology.\nAna Moliner, Director of the Innovation Business Development Department & Strategy at i2CAT, highlights that these first use cases exemplify the Multi-Telco Innovation Labs drive for adopting APIs by the developer ecosystem and identifying new use cases. We demonstrate how this model opens up new opportunities for companies like LAUDE to devise innovative applications with a great social impact by taking advantage of the networks advanced capabilities. This new paradigm will allow us to offer new and better services to citizens.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/334460/334460-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334460\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "The WACKER Group is showcasing its new silicone sealantELASTOSIL[i][sup]®[/sup][/i] eco 7770 P at the European Coatings Show 2025. Developed for construction and sanitary applications, the condensation-curing product is especially suitable for natural stone applications. The sealants special features include high resistance to mold and mildew combined with a low fungicide content and a very-low-emission classification in accordance with the guidelines of the German Association for the Control of Emissions in Products for Flooring Installation (GEV).ELASTOSIL[i][sup]®[/sup][/i] eco 7770 P is manufactured in a resource-efficient manner. It is the first silicone sealant that WACKER is offering exclusively as an eco-product. The European Coatings Show will be held in Nuremberg, Germany, from March 25 to 27, 2025.\nELASTOSIL[i][sup]®[/sup][/i] eco 7770 P is a one-component formulated, almost odorless compound that cures to a low-modulus elastomer with high elastic recovery when exposed to air humidity. Alcohol is split off by the condensation reaction during cross-linking. The sealant adheres to almost all materials commonly used in the construction industry and does not require primed surfaces. The product is weather resistant, equally suitable for indoor and outdoor applications, and can also be used on marble, metals, and other sensitive surfaces.\nWACKER applied a distinctive formulation concept in the manufacturing ofELASTOSIL[i][sup]®[/sup][/i] eco 7770 P. Based on a special non-volatile silicone softener, it is formulated such that it cannot penetrate the pores of natural stone like marble, granite or sandstone. This means that the natural stone substrates adjacent to the joint are not hydrophobized. The natural stone remains spot- and flawless.\nThe sealant formulation also contains a patented silane-based cross-linking system that results in a modified surface structure. The cured product has a smooth surface to which no mold can adhere. As a result, the use of fungicides can be limited to around one hundredth of the amount normally used in standard sanitary sealants.\nWith the crosslinking system and the special plasticizer, WACKER also ensures that only very small quantities of volatile compounds can escape from the sealant during application. Due to its extremely low emissions, which mark the limit of what is technically feasible, the new sealant has been awarded EC 1 plus classification in the EMICODE classification system of the Association for the Control of Emissions in Products for Flooring Installation (GEV).\nWACKER uses biomethanol in the formulation ofELASTOSIL[i][sup]®[/sup][/i] eco 7770 P. In addition, all fossil raw materials used in production are 100 percent offset by sustainably certified biomass. The new silicone sealant is certified in accordance with the REDcert² standard, which ensures traceability throughout the entire manufacturing process  from the manufacture of upstream products to the ready-to-use sealant.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334458/334458-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334458\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Public health emergencies, including outbreaks of cholera, mpox and, more recently, viral haemorrhagic fevers, are posing significant threats to the safety and wellbeing of millions of children in Eastern and Southern Africa, UNICEF said today.\nThe high number of health crises, often worsened by climate shocks, is impacting already vulnerable communities and compounding risks to children in the region.\nThe alarming frequency of public health emergencies and disease outbreaks in the region is disrupting vital safety nets for children and stripping away their right to a safe and nurturing environment, said UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Etleva Kadilli. Global and regional stakeholders must come together to fortify protection systems offered by families, communities and state services to ensure every child can thrive, even in the face of multiple challenges.\nIn 2025, 17 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa are grappling with multiple public health emergencies, the majority of which are outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as polio, measles and diphtheria. Years of stagnating and declining immunization rates across many countries in the region have resulted in a resurgence of these preventable diseases.\nThe region is experiencing major outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Marburg virus disease in Tanzania and Ebola disease caused by the Sudan virus in Uganda. Additionally, mpox continues to be a significant health concern, particularly in Burundi and Uganda, with risks of cross-border transmission due to high levels of population movement.\nFurthermore, cholera is currently affecting 12 countries, including Angola, Burundi, South Sudan, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, with the region recording the highest number of cholera and acute watery diarrhoea deaths globally.\nChildren are inherently more vulnerable to the physical impacts of these diseases due to their developing immune systems and unique physiological characteristics. The risks are even greater for children suffering from malnutrition.\nAdditionally, when a family member falls ill, children are more likely to experience psychological distress and are at greater risk of abuse, violence or even child labour as a survival strategy for families that have been impacted.\nThe risks to children, especially girls - who are often responsible for caring for affected family members - are growing as multiple crises converge. During public health emergencies, women and girls are often at increased risk of sexual abuse, violence and exploitation due to family separation, disruption of social services such as education and healthcare, and increased economic vulnerability.\nThese concurrent and often cyclical emergencies are straining response capacities, undermining important gains in strengthening social services.\nIn addition to providing essential supplies, working with communities and supporting access to education, health, nutrition, as well as water and sanitation, UNICEF is working across the region to protect children from abuse, exploitation and violence.\nEfforts include:\nUNICEF is also working to ensure the continuation of essential services for children in a manner that is safe, respectful and dignified for girls and boys of all ages, including children with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. However, given the scale of public health emergencies, increased funding and international support remain critical.\nIn any emergency, children and the most vulnerable suffer the most, said Kadilli.  Aside from investments in essential infrastructure and services, promoting routine immunization and addressing the social determinants of health, sustained funding for protection efforts must continue to be prioritised to support the overall wellbeing of children in the region.\n####\nAbout UNICEF\nUNICEF, the United Nations agency for children, works to protect the rights of every child, everywhere, especially the most disadvantaged children and in the toughest places to reach. Across more than 190 countries and territories, we do whatever it takes to help children survive, thrive, and fulfil their potential.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334455/334455-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334455\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "The National Football League (NFL) will host its ninth annual NFL Womens Forum presented by Amazon Web Services (AWS) on February 26 in Indianapolis during the 2025 NFL Combine as part of its ongoing, league-wide commitment to inclusion. The program will connect 40 women with leaders in professional football to provide insight and networking opportunities for their careers in the areas of scouting, data & analytics, coaching and football operations.\nSince its 2017 inception, 310 participants have gone through the Forum, with over 250 opportunities emerging for women in all levels of football. 29 clubs have hired past Womens Forum participants, and all 32 clubs engaged in the Forum in some capacity last year. During the 2024-25 season, the NFL had 15 full-time women coaches  a league record and most for any male professional sports league in the world.\nOver the Womens Forum nine-year history, its past participants have gone on to become the first female positional coach in college football history (Heather Marini), the NFLs first black female scout (Salli Clavelle) and coach (Jennifer King), a Super Bowl winning coach (Autumn Lockwood) and one of few Latina coaches, (Isabel Diaz). Additionally, 12 of the NFLs 15 full-time women coaches have participated in the Womens Forum.

Since 2017, the NFL has leveraged AWSs artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services to innovate together to shape the future of football. By collaborating on the Womens Forum, the NFL and AWS aim to empower participants with the knowledge necessary to leverage data and analytics to optimize their impact on the game.\nFor the second year in a row, the NFL will also honor the life and legacy of Buddy Teevens, former Dartmouth College head football coach and advocate for the inclusion of women in football, with the presentation of the Buddy Teevens Forward Progress Award Presentation. Alongside Women Leaders in Sports, the NFL has developed a specialized curriculum for this years Womens Forum participants.\nThe Forum will take place in person and feature engaging panel discussions as well as roundtable conversations with NFL executives, coaches and representatives from across all 32 clubs. For the first time, the Forum will include a candid conversation with 12 NFL women scouts from 12 different NFL teams led and moderated by ESPN football analyst Mina Kimes. The scouts will speak to their unique journeys to the NFL, inspire participants seeking opportunities in the league and discuss the future of football for women.

        "article text": "Today, adidas and Son Heung-min joined forces with the Kinetic Foundation, to show up pitch-side at Harris Academy in North London, as part of the brands mission to highlight the importance of positivity from coaches, parents, supporters and teammates in helping to make athletes believeYou Got This.\nSurprising young footballers during their afternoon training session, Son demonstrated the positive behaviors, which could help encourage up to 20 million more athletes to play sport more regularly. During the session the South Korea captain put adidas Sideline Essentials advice into practice  displaying the five positive behaviors that people on the sidelines should adopt:\nThe brands Sideline Essentials have been created in response to its new global study, which uncovers the Sideline Effect, the impact of negative and positive behaviors from the sidelines. The findings revealed that 4 in 5 amateur athletes regularly experience unhelpful behaviors from coaches, parents, supporters and teammates1. In partnership with sports psychologists and figureheads, the brand highlights common behaviors that many view as helpful but can act as a source of pressure and push many young athletes to quit.\nThe research surveyed over 12,000 athletes across 24 countries and found five actions were identified as having the most negative impact on young athletes desire to participate in sport. To counter this, adidas has created its Sideline Essentials, which have been developed with sports experts, validated by the findings from the research and endorsed by sporting icons including: Aitana Bonmatí, Anthony Edwards, Aliyah Boston, Jürgen Klopp, Lamine Yamal and more.\nThe Sideline Essentials reveal how coaches, parents, supporters and teammates on the sidelines can tackle the most common negative behaviors. They provide high-impact, positive action, which could mean the difference between millions of athletes heading out onto the field or quitting altogether.\nReflecting on the importance of positivity in sport,Son said: Over 90 minutes of football there can be many highs and lows  so in the tough moments, even the smallest bit of support can make the biggest difference. Knowing someone believes in you whether thats your coach, a teammate or a close friend off the pitch  is what gives you the confidence to play with freedom and enjoy each moment. Giving support is such an impactful action but we all need to know what the right type of support looks like and thats why adidas Sideline Essentials is so important. A simple keep going or even a smile from the right person on the sidelines holds so much power, yet can easily be forgotten to be done in the moment  so this advice is a great way for us all to be reminded of what truly works to help all athletes unlock their potential!\nEndorsing adidas Sideline Essentials, James Fotheringham co-founder, Kinetic Foundation, shared:We are so excited to be part of this campaign - as part of the adidasfootball community partner, we share the belief that through football, a positive change can be created, which is why we are huge advocates of its Sideline Essentials. The experience our young people were given today  receiving positive sideline support from an icon at the top of the game  will undoubtedly have a huge impact and we hope its the start of everyone understanding the power of positive sideline behaviors. Knowing that switching to these behaviors could increase participation is why we are looking so forward to rolling them out into our practice, as we aim to help inspire young people on our programme to show up and put the work in, not only on the pitch, but off-the-pitch, too.\nThe youth training session at Harris Academy was organised by Kinetic Foundation and is part of an ongoing programme supported by adidas to help keep next-gen athletes on every playing field of sport.

        "article text": "Siemens is donating several high-performance cogeneration units to Ukraine to supply the country with urgently needed heat and power. This equipment is particularly important for buildings such as hospitals, schools and kindergartens since large parts of Ukraines vital infrastructure have been destroyed by Russia. Distributed cogeneration units can make a contribution to partially restoring this infrastructure.\nThe donation is part of Siemens wide-ranging rebuilding measures and global decarbonization strategy. The company aims to reduce emissions in its own business operations 90 percent by 2030. For instance, a cogeneration unit in Frankfurt, Germany, was recently replaced by other technologies in the course of capacity expansions. In line with the principles of a sustainable circular economy, this unit can now be constructively reused in Ukraine, where it is urgently needed. Further donations of a similar type are in the pipeline.\nOur commitment is driven by our ambitious decarbonization targets and our high aspirations in the area of social responsibility. This first donation is a blueprint that we can now use also for donations of larger cogeneration units to Ukraine, said Veronika Bienert, member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG with responsibility for Siemens Real Estate and Eastern Europe. Such measures are enabling us to contribute  via an intelligent circular economy  to the transformation of energy infrastructure, while alleviating the distress of the Ukrainian people, who are suffering greatly because of the extensive damage to their countrys infrastructure.\nIn the planning and delivery of the donated cogeneration unit, Siemens is collaborating with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (German association for international cooperation, GIZ) GmbH and the Stiftung Technisch Helfen Weltweit (foundation for technical assistance worldwide, Stiftung THW). In the runup to the project, it was important to jointly determine an appropriate use and a suitable location for the unit in Ukraine. The concrete core of the project  which Siemens Real Estate launched as a long-term charitable initiative in collaboration with GIZ and Stiftung THW  is to provide sustainable humanitarian assistance.\nSince the beginning of March 2022, Siemens has been supporting Ukrainian families inside the country as well as refugees from the warzone through numerous humanitarian measures. In the course of their global charitable activities, Siemens AG and Siemens Healthineers worldwide have already donated more than 12 million via Siemens Caring Hands e. V. to aid projects benefiting Ukraine. Over 140 projects with more than 71 partners have been implemented to date.\nSiemens AG(Berlin and Munich) is a leading technology company focused on industry, infrastructure, mobility, and healthcare. The companys purpose is to create technology to transform the everyday, for everyone. By combining the real and the digital worlds, Siemens empowers customers to accelerate their digital and sustainability transformations, making factories more efficient, cities more livable, and transportation more sustainable. Siemens also owns a majority stake in the publicly listed company Siemens Healthineers, a leading global medical technology provider pioneering breakthroughs in healthcare. For everyone. Everywhere. Sustainably.In fiscal 2024, which ended on September 30, 2024, the Siemens Group generated revenue of 75.9 billion and net income of 9.0 billion. As of September 30, 2024, the company employed around 312,000 people worldwide on the basis of continuing operations.

        "article text": "INTRODUCING HANNAHS RIDE JOURNAL\nOver four grueling stages, Hannah tested herself and the Spark RC logging 141 miles of rugged terrain, conquering 16,000 feet of steep climbing and technical descents. Along the way, she experienced both the thrill of the podium and the inevitable challenges that come with endurance racing. No matter the highs or lows, Hannahs enthusiasm for competition shines through, fueling her drive for the next start line.\nAs she traveled back from Spain, she had time to reflect on a season that, despite being just over a month old, has already been packed with accomplishments. From putting in big training miles on a new quiver of bikes to diving straight into a demanding four-day MTB stage race, Hannah shares her experiencesthe triumphs, the struggles, and everything in betweenall with a smile.\nRead Hannahs Med Epic recap in her own words below:\nPUTTING IN THE WORK BEFORE RACEDAY\nThe off season is a time to expand your comfort zone. Its a chance to press into the areas where you feel vulnerable, and to add reinforcement to your racing armor. Most people already do this by spending the winter months building a base foundation for the season ahead. In January alone I spent approximately 115 hours training, but in this modern age of racing, big training blocks are just your ticket to entry at the highest levels. Its all of the other stuff that gives an athlete the winning edge.\nDialing in equipment, testing new set ups, increasing your skills, and practicing nutrition are just some of the many things that I try to dial in during the off season. Creating and establishing routines and practices now will add confidence and security to my races in the season ahead.\nAfter landing a partnership with SCOTT I had a lot of new equipment set ups to play with and to make feel like home. Ive had a lot of new bike days over the years and to be completely honest, I never get too hopped up about it. Dont get me wrong, I get excited and Im extremely grateful, but Ive learned that new bikes take time to truly shred. You have to get used to the set-up, feel, geometry and more. So, when I first went out on my SCOTT Spark, I did so with caution. That lasted all of about 5 minutes. It felt like the bike was made for me. From ride one it fit perfect, it felt perfect, and I felt like every watt I was pressing into the pedals was being expressed through speed on the trails. I never do this, but I abandoned my ride plan for the day and I took off. I dropped my riding partner and I rode sections of the trail that I had resigned as being unrideable previously. It was a match made in heaven.\nOf course, we still took time to make it even better. The trick to dialing in a new bike is to change one small thing, one ride at a time so that you can really hone in on the singular change that youve made and give it time to see if you become accustomed to the change. I might dial in fork pressure one ride, and suspension pressure the next. I might need the saddle moved slightly forward or backward, and once one of those things change, I might need to go back and adjust one of the previously mentioned things. And once the bike is fully set, its time to hit the races.\nTHE MEDITERRANEAN EPICEARLY SEASON TEST\nThe Mediterranean Epic is a 4-Day UCI HC Mountain Bike Stage race on the coast of Spain. The HC designation makes it the highest level of stage race that the UCI offers. The designation is saved for races like the infamous Cape Epic.\nWhy start the season by travelling all the way across the world to a 4-day stage race of the highest level? To continue to expand my comfort zone.\nThe stage race format not only allows me to continue to build fitness, but it allows me 4 chances to put all of the pieces together. It might feel a bit clunky at first, but by day 4 were a well-oiled machine.\nComing from the USA and racing a high-level race in Europe is also an adventure in and of itself. I pack and unpack my suitcase somewhere around 30 times a year, but after a couple month break, its funny how quickly you forget exactly what you need. Before even going to the airport, Ive looked up all of the Stage distances, calculated my estimated finish times, and packed the exact carbs per hour that I need for each and every stage. With suitcase weight limits, you cant afford (literally) to pack too much drink mix, and with European nutrition brands being so different, your gut also cant afford to not have enough.\nWe also pack all of the spare tools and parts we need for any and every circumstance. Not only can I have the spare parts in the feed zone, I also need to have my own parts to make easy adjustments between stages, rather than desperately searching for something to make-do.\nAfter a few days of pre-riding dialing in lines, gear choices, tire pressures, and beating the jet lag, its already time to line up!\nSTAGE 1:After arriving in Europe on Sunday night, it was already time to race on Thursday morning. The first race would feature a blazing 1-hour mountain bike time trial. A time trial is a brutal way to start the year. Racing on your own before having actually felt race pace, leaves a lot of question in your mind around pacing. My mind was still reeling about my pacing strategy as we all lined up to be paraded in to the start ramp. Most of the directions were in Spanish, with an English explanation thrown in every now and then. Its just enough to make you wonder what you missed in the longer Spanish explanation. With athletes from Switzerland, Netherlands, Columbia, Sweden, Poland and more, different languages were circling the air. Its the perfect moment to practice turning inward and visualizing your plan and tuning out the noise.\nAs they counted down to my start, the nerves poured into my body. My hands were tingling and my heart was racing. I exploded off the line, catching the rider who started ahead of me in the first 2 miles. I suffered for my nerve-ridden over-pacing in the final miles as I made mistakes. I crossed the finish line in 6th place, but less than 1 minute away from the podium. With 3 days still ahead, it was anyones game and I had just gotten the nervous jitters out of the system. This is why I start the year with a stage race. I love a good second chance.\nSTAGE 2:Lining up for Stage 2 I was ready to make it count. About 20 minutes into the race, I was feeling invincible, leading the group in the singletrack when all of a sudden, I heard the dreaded sound of sealant spraying everywhere. I whispered to myself, seal, seal, seal but it went flat almost immediately. There was a cameraman filming me as I pulled over on the trail and saw all of my competitors zoom by me as I stuffed 3 plugs into the gapping hole. It still wouldnt seal. I decided I had to move on. I hopped back on my bike, and rode the flat tire on the rim cushioned by an insert for the next 8 miles.\nFor the next 8 miles I felt the race slipping away. I knew the time gap was growing as I nursed my wheel. The language barrier felt at its highest as the amateur men passed me, pointing at my flat, and yelling something in Spanish.\nWhen I finally got to the tech zone, Clayton did a lightning-fast wheel swap and sent me on my way. I felt temporary relief having the situation out of my hands and in his as he tended to my bike, but it was short lived. As I pushed off again, it was just me and the pedals and I needed to self-motivate for the next 3 hours.\nI knew that a placement in Stage 2 was long gone down the trail, but I had to find a way to keep pushing to salvage whatever time I could in the general classification. It was a test of resilience and resolve as I powered away on my own. I crossed the line having moved down to 11th in the overall and with my work cut out for me on Stage 3.\nSTAGE 3:Lining up for Stage 3, I had race nerves behind me from Stage 1 and bad luck behind me from Stage 2. In This stage, I had something to prove.\nAs the trail pointed upward the race broke apart. The amateur men also started to swarm us pro women as we clambered to stay together. I was following closely behind the GC leader when we needed to pass one of the amateur men. We hollered to get around. She made the pass, but he didnt see me coming and moved over right as I tried to jet around him. We hit bars and I was sent off the trail. Racing is also more physical in Europe. This situation was one that I would log away as another excellent early season lesson that I would be better from later on. The gap to first formed in that moment and for hours I could see glimpses of the yellow jersey just up ahead but the chasm seemed too big to cross. It was a relentless and ruthless pursuit, but I knew that even if I never caught her, my efforts would pay off by putting in time on those behind.\nI finished up Stage 3 in 2nd place and my strong performance allowed me to move up to 5th in the Overall GC. One stage left to go.\nSTAGE 4:For me, Stage 4 was about going for broke, racing with curiosity and seeing what I could do. I hit it right from the line and by the first singletrack section, I was leading off the front with just the GC leader on my wheel.\nThe SCOTT Spark absolutely hauled through the technical singletrack trails. Riding huge rock gardens with drops and ledges is not for the faint of heart, and along with peeled eyes, you have to rely on your bike to pick up the slack when you pick a wrong line in the heat of the moment. The Spark delivered on all accounts.\nFor the rest of the stage, it was mountain biking at its best. I was locking out my suspension and hammering on the climbs, and risking it all on the descents. The GC leader and I traded positions and attacks for well over 15 miles. With each attack it felt like the heat of the race escalated and our respect for each others abilities elevated as well.\nThe race came all the way down to the final meters in a tactical move. I finished Stage 4 in 2nd and the performance once again allowed me to move up in the GC. Tenacity and determination allowed me to move up to 4th overall in the GC after 4 days of racing.\nAt the finish line, after hours of battling on the bike, my competitors and I hugged. Language barriers and culture differences seem to melt away in a mutual love for the bike.\nTAKEAWAYS\nThe 2025 season opener was everything I wanted it to be. I worked through the rust, proved my fitness, and walked away a better bike racer. I got to represent SCOTT on my first podium performances of the season and the Spark passed its first test with flying colors. Now Im heading back to the USA, and prepping for my next race in just a few short weeks, my gravel season opener where Ill get to test out the SCOTT Addict Gravel RC at BWR Arizona.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334430/334430-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334430\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

Led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and supported by H&M Foundation, the project empowers leading brands to identify solutions and unlock barriers to scale circular business models and begin to decouple revenue from production.\nProject name:The Fashion ReModelProject time period:20242028Focus area:Research & DemonstrationPartner:Ellen MacArthur FoundationCountry/countries:GlobalDonation:16 500 000 SEK\nThe projects ambitious framework is designed to scale circular business model solutions. If scaled, this way of doing business could be an important step that contributes towards the decarbonisation of the textile industry by providing considerable reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, encouraging a pivot away from low utilisation trends, and creating a new type of growth. To take part, brands and retailers set an ambition to increase the percentage of their revenue derived from circular business models over the next three years and report their progress to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation annually.\nRevenue must be decoupled from the production of new garments and the use of natural resources.

Demonstration projects like this are not about solving everything all at once, theyre about getting started, building confidence, showing other actors in the system what is possible, and increasing the minimum bar over time. By delivering a replicable roadmap, the project is creating conditions for systemic adoption of circular business models.\nFor a circular economy for fashion to become the norm, we must accelerate efforts that not only redesign the products of the future, but also the services and business models that deliver them and keep them in use.

        "article text": "Sisley, an urban lifestyle brand boasting a hedonistic spirit, presents the SS25 collection with Denim For Two, a campaign shot by photographer Sebastián Faena that is a tribute to the origins and values ​​of the brand.\nWe have been making jeans since 1968 and every pair is designed to be lived in. So states the incipit of the manifesto that guides the new Spring Summer 2025 campaign. Two protagonists, a 100% denim story. Together, Swedish model Simona Kust  who debuted with Yves Saint Laurent  and Raphael Diogo  an American model of Brazilian origin with a background in Ju-Jitsu  embody the duality of Sisley denim: strength and sensuality, contemporaneity and timeless charm.\nThe backdrop for the campaign is the Villa Galaxie in Cannes, an iconic glass and steel 1960s residence overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. Thus the brand returns to its French origins, hosted in an emblematic location where modernity dialogues with nature, reprising the theme of the double.\nThe intimate and luminous photography bears the signature of Sebastián Faena. An Argentine director and photographer born in 1990, Faena has already worked for some of the most famous magazines in the fashion industry includingVogue Italia,Harpers Bazaar,Vanity FairandV Magazinewith a gaze capable of narrating fashion and above all the stories that run through it.\nDenim For Two is the beginning of a new story for Sisley denim, born from archive research and stylistic evolution. For SS25 the codes of the 1980s and 2000s merge into a modern aesthetic: the fits have evolved, but retain heritage details, such as the tag with the historic claims Relaxed Elegance and For Country or City Walks. The womens fits range from slim, straight and tapered to wide leg and chino; for men the choices include skinny, slim, regular and carrot. Each model is designed to be worn in total freedom, whether in the city or in nature, whether alone or with ones partner.\nThe Denim For Two campaign is the starting point of a 360-degree strategy to reaffirm the role of denim in Sisleys DNA. A long-term progamme that will translate into a greater presence in physical and digital touchpoints, with special windows in flagship stores and a a dedicated focus in the first months of 2025.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334427/334427-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334427\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

Im really enjoying what Im reading and I appreciate the writers deep expressions in regards to her love towards her pet cats and animals and the love they give back to you. And her adventures with her kitty cats. A really nice book to read!  Terry B.\nAt the upcomingLondon Book Fair (LBF) 2025, hundreds of new books are expected to be exhibited, and many of them will be telling a story from the worlds hidden corners. So, for freelance writer-turned-animal activist Indrani Sircar, it is an ideal place to tell the story of her citys secret animals.Her books title is simplyPeople and Other Animals: Story of a Neighborhood.Whereas the LBF will undoubtedly have thousands of books on the planets wilder ecosystems, Sircar has opted to tell the story of the urban jungle and the unexpected cat family she had taken in there.People and Other Animalsis the result of Sircars own personal journey, having traveled from Canada to live in a little-known city somewhere in Northern California. The book chronicles the days she had spent exploring the city streets, encountering the many characters whose stories would be told in her work. Among them was a neighbor who fed the resident feral cats as well as a couple who had taken the responsibility of caring for wildlife that had strayed in. It also shares her increasing involvement in the citys animal welfare and rescue circles.It is her hope thatPeople and Other Animals: Story of a Neighborhoodwill attract distributors and readers interested in literature about the hidden wildlife in todays increasingly urbanized world. Visitors to the London Book Fair 2025 can find Indrani Sircars book displayed at the self-publishing and book marketing company ReadersMagnets exhibit at stand no. 6A90.

This is what happened to Karen Raffa, a writer who had not only been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but she had experienced depression as well as much loss in her life just within the span of two-and-a-half years. She lays it all bare in her own memoirHow A Gray Seed Became A Peace Lily.For the most part,How A Gray Seed Became A Peace Lilyis a raw, honest recounting of the worst moments in her life. The most devastating was when she lost her spouse of 31 years to lung cancer. The challenges of her mental health had only compounded her loss, even leading her to the brink of suicide.Yet, even as she shares these vulnerable thoughts, she also offers a heavy helping of hope in the form of her faith and shares an in-depth, detailed account of her heart and mind when she turned to God for strength.Raffa has already arranged to have her book exhibited at various book events, including two upcoming ones this April in California. The first is theLos Angeles Book Confab, which is organized by the self-publishing and book marketing company ReadersMagnet and will be held on April 23-24, 2025, at the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City, Universal City.The second book event is the2025 L.A.

        "article text": "Join the Mud Pups on their high-rolling adventures with their handler, Red!\nFor most of the authors and publishers exhibiting at the London Book Fair, the goal is to increase visibility, attract distributors as well as learn about the newest trends in the global marketplace for literature. However, there are also those who simply want their displays to honor the artistic and creative minds behind the books, even when they have already passed away.This is the case for late childrens book author and artist Rocky Schrecengost, whose book,Mud Pups AdventuresVol. 1, will be exhibited at theLondon Book Fair 2025by the self-publishing and book marketing ReadersMagnet at stand #6A90.While an oil field worker for most of his life, Rocky actually nurtured a hidden, artistic talent and was often known among his friends for remodeling projects and colorful, hand-painted signage. He also enjoyed spending time with loved ones, especially watching children and pets play.This was how he eventually came up with the idea for the weird yet wonderful concept ofMud Pups Adventures.With illustrations he made himself, Rocky tells the story of strange but adorable puppies with wheels instead of feet. Together with their handler Red, they have a fun time racing through the mud after the rain.Schrecengosts wife, Kitty, has recently been in charge of promoting the book in her husbands memory.Mud Pups Adventuresbrings together the many wonderful moments he had made with all those who knew him. She hopes the books display can serve to share his creativity with the world.Visitors to the 2025 London Book Fair can take a look through Rocky SchrecengostsMud Pups AdventuresVol. 1 when it goes on display at the exhibit space of ReadersMagnet.

        "article text": "Simply is juicing up the prebiotic soda category with a fruit-forward line of beverages made with 6 grams of prebiotic fiber to support gut health and Vitamin C and Zinc to support immune function.\nSimply Pop includes no added sugar and 25-30% real fruit juice from concentrate (a first for the fast-growing segment). Five boldly delicious flavors familiar to Simply fans  Strawberry, Pineapple Mango, Fruit Punch, Lime and Citrus Punch  will be offered exclusively in 12-oz., shelf-stable slim cans.\nSimply Pop hits shelves later this month at retailers in select regions and online nationwide via Amazon Fresh. The brand will expand to additional markets nationwide throughout 2025.\nBecca Kerr, CEO of Nutrition, The Coca‑Cola Company, says the team took a disciplined, consumer-driven approach throughout the products journey, from ideation to launch.\nWe found that consumers, especially wellness-focused Gen Z-ers and Millennials, were really interested in juice and prebiotic sodas, Kerr said. And since many brands in this category are new, they were looking to align with names they know and trust for both quality and taste. This was particularly true for those curious about prebiotic sodas but who hadnt yet taken the leap. We knew that in order to bring new drinkers into the category, we had to strike that perfect balance of innovation and trust.\nWith more than two decades of expertise and equity in juice, Simplys credentials made it the ideal choice to lead the companys entry into prebiotic sodas. Since launching as an orange juice brand in 2001, the Simply portfolio has expanded to more than 20 varieties of juices, juice drinks, ades, smoothies and more.\nTerika Fasakin, North America Brand Senior Director, Simply and Kids, shares insight into the brands connection with its audience. \"Gen Z grew up with this brand\" she said. \"They dont remember a world where Simply doesnt exist, and its the juice theyve seen in the fridge throughout their lives, so it has a particular tug on their heartstrings\"\nThe team spent over a year refining the Simply Pop taste profile, packaging and playful visual identity through extensive taste tests and consumer feedback sessions. Notably, all five flavors are mainstays in the Simply lineup.\nOut-of-home, digital and influencer-driven social media creative, as well as robust sampling and experiential activations, will promote the phased launch. Later in the year, the brand will team up with leading media company, Dear Media, for a podcast tour where well-known hosts will discuss the juiciest pop culture topics over Simply Pop.\nThis has truly been a labor of love for the team because we know Simply Pop is a great-tasting prebiotic soda consumers want, Fasakin said. Weve pushed ourselves to move fast while staying strategic and focused. And, as we get feedback from consumers who taste Simply Pop and engage with the brand, well continue to evolve.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334411/334411-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334411\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "BASF and Sherwin-Williams have signed an agreement on the sale of the Brazilian decorative paints business, which is part of BASFs Coatings division. The purchase price on a cash and debt-free basis is $1.15 billion. The transaction is structured as a share deal and includes the production sites in Demarchi and Jaboatão, related contracts, the Suvinil and Glasu! brands, and the around 1,000 employees. The divestiture is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to the approval of the relevant competition authorities.\nThe decorative paints business, which generated sales of approximately $525 million in 2024, is BASFs only sizeable B2C business and has a wide portfolio of paints and paint preparation products as well as digital solutions.

We are deeply grateful to our employees for their hard work and dedication, which have made Suvinil the most recognized brand for decorative paints in Brazil.\nFor more than 60 years, Suvinil has been synonymous with innovation and quality. The business is highly complementary to Sherwin-Williams in Latin America, as the Suvinil brand is well-known and highly-trusted by purchasing influencers and specifiers across the value chain. We are excited to capitalize on the strengths of both companies to further enhance value for customers, said Heidi G. Petz, Sherwin-Williams Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer. We have tremendous respect for the expertise and dedication of the Suvinil team, and we are excited about the opportunities that this combination will provide to customers and employees.\nBASF and Sherwin-Williams will continue to operate as strictly independent companies until the completion of the transaction. Business continuity for customers will be ensured throughout the transaction process. In accordance with legal requirements and local practice, employee representatives of the decorative paints business will be involved.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, BASF intends to approach the market to further explore strategic options for its remaining Coatings activities, which include automotive OEM coatings, refinish coatings and surface treatment.\nAbout BASF\nAt BASF, we create chemistry for a sustainable future. We combine economic success with environmental protection and social responsibility. Around 112,000 employees in the BASF Group contribute to the success of our customers in nearly all sectors and almost every country in the world.

        "article text": "Researchers have found that engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity during leisure time, regardless of occupational physical activity, is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. A combination of sedentary leisure-time activity and demanding occupational activity may increase the risk. Findings from anovel study opens in new tab/window, appearing in theAmerican Journal of Preventive Medicineopens in new tab/window, published by Elsevier, add to the body of knowledge that simple lifestyle changes, like recreational physical activity, can make a big difference and can contribute to the global prevention of type 2 diabetes.\nThe prevalence of type 2 diabetes has more than doubled worldwide over the past decade, making it a major public health burden and a societal challenge.\nFirst author Anna Stage, MSc, Center for Clinical Research and Prevention, Frederiksberg and Bispebjerg Hospital, Denmark, says, The World Health Organization (WHO) states that physical activity contributes to preventing and managing noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. The current WHO physical activity guidelines do not distinguish in which domains (e.g., work or leisure time) the recommended physical activity takes place. Our findings revealed that while leisure-time physical activity demonstrated a significant protective effect on type 2 diabetes incidence regardless of occupational physical activity level, no similar benefits were observed for occupational physical activity, suggesting that the Physical Activity Health Paradox, which refers to the contrasting associations of physical activity during leisure time and occupational physical activity with cardiovascular disease, may also apply to type 2 diabetes. Currently the evidence is inconsistent and scarce.\nThis register-based study utilized data from 5,866 working adults aged 30-60 in the Inter99 cohort in Denmark. Assessment of type 2 diabetes status and date of diagnosis were based on the Danish Diabetes Register covering prevalent and incident diabetes from January 1, 1996 to June 30, 2020. In addition to undergoing a physical examination, participants answered a questionnaire about their levels of occupational physical activity and leisure-time physical activity. Data were analyzed in 2024, taking relevant variables into account.\nThe main findings of the research are:\nStrenuous physical activity at work could be associated with incident type 2 diabetes, however, this was not a statistically significant finding.\nPhysical activity during leisure time with moderate to vigorous intensity was associated with a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes.\nSedentary leisure-time activity, such as watching TV or reading, combined with a job that requires any kind of physical activity, was significantly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\nModerate to vigorous intensity physical activity during leisure time combined with any level of occupational physical activity was protective for incident type 2 diabetes.\nStage points out, \"It is noteworthy that the WHO recommendations on physical activity do not distinguish between work and leisure time, hence sending a potentially misleading message that daily physical activity accrued during work hours is sufficient to comply with current activity guidelines. However, our findings along with those of others underscore that leisure-time, not occupational, moderate to vigorous physical activity seems to reduce the risk of incident type 2 diabetes, other noncommunicable diseases, and all-cause mortality\"\nThe article isThe Physical Activity Health Paradox in Type 2 Diabetes,by Anna Stage, Rasmus Wibaek, Pernille F.

        "article text": "Within the animal kingdom, mussels are masters of underwater adhesion. The marine molluscs cluster atop rocks and along the bottoms of ships, and hold fast against the oceans waves thanks to a gluey plaque they secrete through their foot. These tenacious adhesive structures have prompted scientists in recent years to design similar bioinspired, waterproof adhesives.\nNow engineers from MIT and Freie Universität Berlin have developed a new type of glue that combines the waterproof stickiness of the mussels plaques with the germ-proof properties of another natural material: mucus.\nEvery surface in our bodies not covered in skin is lined with a protective layer of mucus  a slimy network of proteins that acts as a physical barrier against bacteria and other infectious agents. In their new work, the engineers combined sticky, mussel-inspired polymers with mucus-derived proteins, or mucins, to form a gel that strongly adheres to surfaces.\nThe new mucus-derived glue prevented the buildup of bacteria while keeping its sticky hold, even on wet surfaces. The researchers envision that once the glues properties are optimized, it could be applied as a liquid by injection or spray, which would then solidify into a sticky gel. The material might be used to coat medical implants, for example, to prevent infection and bacteria buildup.\nThe teams new glue-making approach could also be adjusted to incorporate other natural materials, such as keratin  a fibrous substance found in feathers and hair, with certain chemical features resembling those of mucus.\nThe applications of our materials design approach will depend on the specific precursor materials, says George Degen, a postdoc in MITs Department of Mechanical Engineering. For example, mucus-derived or mucus-inspired materials might be used as multifunctional biomedical adhesives that also prevent infections. Alternatively, applying our approach to keratin might enable development of sustainable packaging materials.\nA paper detailing the teams resultsappears this week in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Degens MIT co-authors include Corey Stevens, Gerardo Cárcamo-Oyarce, Jake Song, Katharina Ribbeck, and Gareth McKinley, along with Raju Bej, Peng Tang, and Rainer Haag of Freie Universität Berlin.\nA sticky combination\nBefore coming to MIT, Degen was a graduate student at the University of California at Santa Barbara, where he worked in a research group that studied the adhesive mechanisms of mussels.\nMussels are able to deposit materials that adhere to wet surfaces in seconds to minutes, Degen says. These natural materials do better than existing commercialized adhesives, specifically at sticking to wet and underwater surfaces, which has been a longstanding technical challenge.\nTo stick to a rock or a ship, mussels secrete a protein-rich fluid. Chemical bonds, or cross-links, act as connection points between proteins, enabling the secreted substance to simultaneously solidify into a gel and stick to a wet surface.\nAs it happens, similar cross-linking features are found in mucin  a large protein that is the primary non-water component of mucus. When Degen came to MIT, he worked with both McKinley, a professor of mechanical engineering and an expert in materials science and fluid flow, and Katharina Ribbeck, a professor of biological engineering and a leader in the study of mucus, to develop a cross-linking glue that would combine the adhesive qualities of mussel plaques with the bacteria-blocking properties of mucus.\nMixing links\nThe MIT researchers teamed up with Haag and colleagues in Berlin who specialize in synthesizing bioinspired materials. Haag and Ribbeck are members of a collaborative research group that develops dynamic hydrogels for biointerfaces. Haags group has made mussel-like adhesives, as well as mucus-inspired liquids by producing microscopic, fiber-like polymers that are similar in structure to the natural mucin proteins.\nFor their new work, the researchers focused on a chemical motif that appears in mussel adhesives: a bond between two chemical groups known as catechols and thiols. In the mussels natural glue, or plaque, these groups combine to form catecholthiol cross-links that contribute to the cohesive strength of the plaque. Catechols also enhance a mussels adhesion by binding to surfaces such as rocks and ship hulls.\nInterestingly, thiol groups are also prevalent in mucin proteins. Degen wondered whether mussel-inspired polymers could link with mucin thiols, enabling the mucins to quickly turn from a liquid to a sticky gel.\nTo test this idea, he combined solutions of natural mucin proteins with synthetic mussel-inspired polymers and observed how the resulting mixture solidified and stuck to surfaces over time.\nIts like a two-part epoxy. You combine two liquids together, and chemistry starts to occur so that the liquid solifidies while the substance is simultaneously glueing itself to the surface, Degen says.\nDepending on how much cross-linking you have, we can control the speed at which the liquids gelate and adhere, Haag adds. We can do this all on wet surfaces, at room temperature, and under very mild conditions. This is what is quite unique.\nThe team deposited a range of compositions between two surfaces and found that the resulting adhesive held the surfaces together, with forces comparable to the commercial medical adhesives used for bonding tissue. The researchers also tested the adhesives bacteria-blocking properties by depositing the gel onto glass surfaces and incubating them with bacteria overnight.\nWe found if we had a bare glass surface without our coating, the bacteria formed a thick biofilm, whereas with our coating, biofilms were largely prevented, Degen notes.\nThe team says that with a bit of tuning, they can further improve the adhesives hold. Then, the material could be a strong and protective alternative to existing medical adhesives.\nWe are excited to have established a biomaterials design platform that gives us these desirable properties of gelation and adhesion, and as a starting point weve demonstrated some key biomedical applications, Degen says. We are now ready to expand into different synthetic and natural systems and target different applications.\nThis research was funded, in part, by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Army Research Office.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334405/334405-1.png)\nWebWireID334405\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

(Tokyo: 7823; Chairman & President: IGARASHI Yoshikata) today announced a February 2025 start date for production of custom-made wig molds using biomass urethane, in an effort to help create a sustainable society.\nCustom-made wigs are manufactured to fit the shape of each individuals head. Precise measurements of the persons head shape are taken using a 3D scanner, after which urethane is trimmed to produce a mold of the same shape. As a mold with accurate dimensions is fundamental to the production of a wig that fits comfortably on the head, urethane has been the material of choice for these molds, due to its outstanding dimensional stability and the ease with which it can be trimmed. The cap that forms the wigs base is fabricated to fit the shape of the mold, with hairs then added to the cap to produce the finished wig.\nWhile petroleum-derived urethane has conventionally been used to produce custom-made wig molds, switching to a biomass-based material has reduced both the quantity of waste and the volume of CO2emissions when incinerated. Derived from non-edible castor oil, the new material has 20 percent biomass content and is expected to reduce waste by 12 tons and CO2emissions by 70 tons*roughly half the current levelannually.\n*Figures calculated by Mitsui Chemicals based on information supplied by ARTNATURE.\nCollaboration across sectoral boundaries will be essential in order to achieve carbon neutrality and create a circular economy. We will continue to grow and develop sustainably together with society through the realization of a recycling-oriented society in harmony with the environment.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334404/334404-1.png)\nWebWireID334404\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

These are areas where there are still thousands of displaced people.\nMarcus Bachmann, MSF head of programs for South Kivu province, breaks down the current situation on the ground.\nWhile the hotspot of the conflict has beenNorth Kivu, neighboring South Kivu province has also long been receiving displaced people and has been touched by the violence. In the first three weeks of 2025, with the intensification of the conflict, MSF-supported health structures in northern South Kivu received more than 315 injured patients.\nIn late January, M23 took control of Numbi in the highlands of northern South Kivu, and of Minova, by the shores of Lake Kivu. Following the takeover of Goma, North Kivus capital, the group continued making quick advances in South Kivu. Last week, they captured the strategic towns of Kalehe and Kavumu.\nThe city has been quite empty, with hardly any traffic, and very few people walking in the streets, as many residents opted to stay at home and others left town. The situation is still volatile. -Marcus Bachmann, MSF head of programs for South Kivu province\nOver the weekend, M23 fighters progressively entered Bukavu, South Kivus capital and one of the most populated cities in eastern DRC, as FARDC troops and allied forces reportedly withdrew from the town. Major armed clashes havent taken place in Bukavu, but there has been widespread looting and shootings amid the chaos. The city has been quite empty, with hardly any traffic, and very few people walking in the streets, as many residents opted to stay at home and others left town. The situation is still volatile.\nWe were not running regular medical activities in Bukavu, but we have offices to coordinate activities in the province. However, we have now started to support four hospitals in the city to deal with big influxes of injured and to reinforce capacity for treating victims and survivors of sexual violence.\nBy Monday, February 17, our supported hospitals in Bukavu had already received 48 injured patients with wounds from gunshots and shrapnel, as a result of the violence that has taken place over the last few days. In one of the hospitals, they received 42 of these patients; all the injured were civilians, including 11 people under 18 years of age, and 16 of them were women.\nIn the north of South Kivu province, MSF continues to provide support to various departments of Minova General Referral Hospital, three other health centers in Minova health zone, and Numbi health center. These are areas where there are still thousands of displaced people.\nIn Uvira, further south in South Kivu province, where our teams have been providing care for patients with mpox in recent months, the situation has also become quite concerning. Fighting has been reported on the road from Bukavu to Uvira, and the general hospital there is receiving dozens of injured people, including civilians.\nWe are closely assessing the situation and exploring ways to scale up our emergency efforts to respond to the humanitarian needs of people in areas around Minova, Bukavu, and Uvira.\nAs thousands of people have been crossing the border from South Kivu into Burundi to seek refuge in the province of Cibitoke, MSF has immediately dispatched a team to assess the urgent needs and provide emergency assistance in cooperation with the Burundian authorities. MSFs priority is to support access to primary health care through mobile clinics, improve sanitation and access to water, and fight epidemics such asmeaslesandcholera.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334400/334400-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334400\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Until 15 June and thanks to the sponsorship of the Fundación Amigos del Museo del Prado, eight of the nine works that El Greco painted for the conventual church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in Toledo will be displayed in the Central Gallery of the Villanueva Building for the first time since their dispersal.\nThe Assumption, the large central canvas for the principal altarpiece, which has been in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago since 1906, is displayed alongside the two works from that altarpiece in the collection of the Museo del Prado, the canvases that remain in Santo Domingo el Antiguo, and those now in other collections.\nCurated by Leticia Ruiz, Head of the Collection of Spanish Renaissance Painting, the reuniting of these works is a remarkable artistic event which will allow visitors to see an exceptional group within El Grecos early output in Spain.\nIn mid-1577, having recently arrived in Spain, El Greco secured the two most important commissions of his career to date: The Disrobing of Christ for Toledo cathedral and the three altarpieces for the Cistercian convent of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, one of the oldest religious houses in the city.\nThe convents church was rebuilt in a classicising style between 1576 and 1579, funded by Doña María de Silva (1513-1575), a Portuguese gentlewoman in the service of the Empress Isabel, wife of Charles V, and by Diego de Castilla (ca. 1507-1584), dean of the cathedral. This new space was intended as the burial place of the two benefactors.\nFor the construction of the main altarpiece and the two lateral ones in the church, Diego de Castilla designated El Greco on the suggestion of his son Luis de Castilla (ca. 1540-1618), who had met the painter in the Farnese palace in Rome in 1571. Thanks to this recommendation El Greco secured a particularly complex commission, for which he had to design the structure of the three altarpieces, the five sculptures that surmounted the main one and paint eight canvases. The overall conception of the programme represented a renewal of the traditional Castilian altarpiece. The principal altarpiece was structured around a large canvas on the subject of The Assumption, to which the other paintings were subordinated: the four saints in the lateral sections  Saint John the Baptist, Saint John the Evangelist, Saint Bernard and Saint Benedict  and The Trinity in the upper section. Years after the church was consecrated, a coat of arms carved in wood and located above the principal painting was covered with a depiction of The Holy Face, also by El Greco.\nThe commission was completed in 1579 and the result must have aroused the admiration of those who saw it. El Greco proved to be a great master, bold and capable, who applied himself with dazzling ease to the composition of large-format works filled with Italianate reminiscences both in the figurative models and in the colour and pictorial technique.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334399/334399-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334399\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

The digital collection can be purchased for $2.50 at film-east.com\nFilm East, the independent UK and USA film organization, has released a brand-new publication inspired by 2024s break-out album of the year, Brat by Charli XCX.​​Brat but its literally not because its just a bratty movie collection is a 60-page zine filled with film and TV show recommendations based on the themes, narratives and sonic landscapes crafted throughout the revolutionary hyper-pop album. The 18 cinematic works featured within its pages are each paired with a song from Brats tracklist, presenting readers with a program of moving pictures that honor the vivid and detailed environments created by Charli XCX in her music. Each pick is accompanied by expert analysis from the publications curators, justifying the track and film pairing and explaining how they believe the work falls into the Brat-o-sphere.Examples of pairings include Roger Kumbles Cruel Intentions with Guess featuring billie eilish, HBOs Succession with Apple, and A24s Climax with Club classics.A trailer for the collection can be viewed on YouTube.Brat but its literally not because its just a bratty movie collection was officially released on February 10, 2025. The zine is available now for digital download and costs $2.50. It can be purchased atfilm-east.com.The collection is curated by Film Easts Shelby Cooke and William Schofield. Cooke, Film Easts Head Curator and Editor-in-Chief, is a founder of Film East and is a film and culture critic. She has a Masters degree in Film Studies and has written and lectured extensively on the relationship between music and film. Schofield has been with the organization since 2021. He is a film archivist and has expertise in the auteur theory and the cinematic canon.Cooke says of the publication: Brat spoke to a lot of people in a way no one expected. Charlis album has become an anthem for the 20/30-somethings who are exhausted by perpetually living in unprecedented times. Brats cultural impact is undeniable, but not solely because of the music. Theres an obvious visual nature to Brat, so it seemed only fitting to combine Film Easts curatorial background with our love for Charlis album.At Film East, we strive to find fun and entertaining ways to get people interested in the artistry of filmmaking. Our mission with every project we produce is to provide a space for audiences to learn more about this art form and become enlightened media consumers. We thought what better way to do this than by taking on the phenomenon that is Brat and highlighting for readers bold, challenging and visually exciting works from various decades, cultures and nationalities.Film East is a multi-award-winning film organization based in the East of England and the East Coast of the United States. Since its founding in Norwich, UK in 2019, the group has provided a platform for audiences to experience and interact with film.

        "article text": "Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that a federal judge had granted a request by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to require three dairies in the Lower Yakima Valley of Washington to provide well testing and bottled water or water treatment systems to well users near Granger, Washington.According to the EPA announcement:EPA believes the health of people in the area could be at risk from nitrate-polluted drinking water and alleges that three large dairies in that area have contributed nitrate to the areas groundwater and contaminated drinking water wells.In many areas of the nation, nitrate is principally a by-product of nitrogen use in fertilizer for agricultural purposes. Its presence in groundwater can also come from septic systems, confined animal feeding operations, and from treated wastewater. This means there are potentially countless people, especially in agricultural areas that could be drinking water with elevated nitrate levels.EPA warns that nitrate is an acute contaminant and that a single exposure can pose health risks, including a condition in infants known as methemoglobinemia that can result in death, said Joseph Frasca of Senior Vice President of Marketing at EMSL Analytical, Inc. There are also other health concerns, especially for pregnant women. The only way to know if nitrate contamination is a potential problem for those dependent on private wells is to have the water tested. EMSL Analytical, with laboratories across North America, provides water testing services. We even offer a Drinking Water Test Kit that monitors for nitrate and nitrite, as well as lead, total coliform,E. coli, turbidity, iron, manganese, and pH.EMSL sponsored an educational video about private wells and the importance of testing drinking water quality several years ago that can still be seen at:https://youtu.be/9mtMqsTiNagTo learn more about nitrate and other water testing resources, please visitwww.EMSL.com, emailinfo@EMSL.com, or call (800) 220-3675.

        "article text": "Danny Dyer has tackled a lot in his career - gangsters, geezers, even the Bard himself. But now hes facing his biggest challenge yet: investing in and running a holiday caravan park with his daughter Dani by his side in a brand-new Sky Original six-part series from Expectation (Clarksons Farm, Miracles, Dynamo is Dead). As Danny said himself: Clarksons got his Farm, Hammonds got his workshop. If Jamie Oliver can save school dinners  why cant I save the great British holiday?\nWith childhood nostalgia in his heart and business ambition in his sights, Danny and Dani are diving headfirst into the £7 billion holiday park industry. Theyll stop at nothing in their quest to transform a caravan park into a place that lives up to Dannys misty-eyed memories of the best holidays hes ever had in his life.\nBut this venture is no knees-up at the Queen Vic. Danny will soon discover that running the park is a world away from the life of an A-list actor as he faces everything from dodgy plumbing to demanding punters, rogue acts to reinvigorating the restaurant menu. But will his new business partners, the parks residents or even Dani be on board with his grand, nostalgic vision?\nWith an unforgettable cast of real-life characters, The Dyers Caravan Park (w/t) is a hilarious, heartwarming and occasionally chaotic trip into what really makes the Great British holiday so great.\nDanny Dyercommented:What you might not know about me is I love a caravan, and I love a caravan site. So, with my daughter Dani by my side, as the voice of reason, Im taking charge of one. Im chucking in a few quid, and will try and make the greatest of British holidays cool again. Now this could be a triumph; or a complete f***ing failure. But theres only one way to find out and thats to roll the f***ing dice.\nDani Dyercommented:My dad wants to get involved in the caravan park and Im all in: I love a caravan,  so why not? My dad is a very friendly person  hes good at bringing everyone in - but has he got what it takes to make a success of this? I think he has, just so long as people dont decide to go to Magaluf.\nPhil Edgar-Jones, Executive Director, Unscripted Originals at Sky, commented:The Great British Holiday is about to get a turbo-charged makeover like never before as the Dyers Caravan Park prepares to open its gates. If anyone can make caravanning cool again its Danny and Dani, and we cannot wait to see them bring the fun.\nBen Wicks, Creative Director, Entertainment at Expectation said:We are thrilled about working with Danny and Dani Dyer as they try to save the Great British Summer holiday. Their passion for caravanning is unlimited, yet their experience of running a caravan park is extremely limited. Based on our extensive research, running a caravan park if you dont know what you are doing is quite frankly, a nightmare. We feel this is the perfect setting for a series as rich in comedy, jeopardy, and warmth  even if the weather isnt  and were delighted that Sky feel the same.\nThe Dyers Caravan Park (w/t, 6x60) was commissioned by Phil Edgar-Jones, Executive Director, Unscripted Originals at Sky for Cécile Frot-Coutaz, CEO of Sky Studios & Chief Content Officer for Sky and goes into production this month. The Commissioning Editor for Sky is Shirley Jones. The Dyers Caravan Park (w/t) is produced by Expectation. The executive producers are Ben Wicks and Jordan Read. Josh Jacobs serves as the series director, and the project was developed by Dan Cripps, Amy Dallmeyer and Harry Forte. Denise Kadoo is the production executive and Jo Bucci the head of production.\nThe Dyers Caravan Park (w/t) will air on Sky Max and NOW later this year.\nFor more information, contactLucy.Butterfield@sky.uk/Molly.Wyatt@sky.uk\nExpectation launched in February 2017 as a multi-genre, independent production company covering both scripted and non-scripted programming.

        "article text": "EDGE, one of the worlds leading advanced technology and defence groups, and Leonardo, a major global industrial group that builds technological capabilities in aerospace, defence, and security, have signed a groundbreaking collaboration agreement to further enhance their partnership in developing solutions across six critical domains. The agreement aims to strengthen existing synergies and capitalise on new complementary opportunities for deeper cooperation.\nThe pivotal agreement, signed at the International Defence Exhibition (IDEX) 2025, currently taking place in Abu Dhabi, establishes a strategic framework for the UAE market while advancing a global export strategy. It aims to enhance synergies, facilitate knowledge exchange, and optimise specialised resources to capitalise on emerging opportunities more effectively.

Fundamentally, however, it reinforces our vision of growth through mutually beneficial partnerships, ensuring a win-win approach to sourcing and realising complementary multi-domain opportunities across the world, and expanding these synergies for continued economic growth, innovation, and excellence, all in support of the sustainable preservation of security.\nThe agreement is a precursor to a structured partnership focused on jointly marketing these products and solutions to governments across multiple countries. It also commits to the development of shared intellectual property (IP) and future design innovations.\nLorenzo Mariani, Co-General Manager of Leonardo, added: We are deeply honoured and thrilled to collaborate with EDGE Group, aiming to establish unprecedented industrial capabilities for national and export requirements. The sectors identified as pillars of this joint strategy are getting more and more important in an evolving market and operational scenario. That is why we believe that joining forces in these fields will deliver the level of capabilities that the UAE and other export markets are requiring.\nThe strategic agreement aims to further enhance the capabilities of both EDGE and Leonardo in the design of cutting-edge, complex systems in disruptive sectors with significant market potential, and is a crucial step in diversifying and expanding both groups portfolios of airborne, terrestrial, naval, and cyber solutions.\nAbout EDGELaunched in November 2019, the UAEs EDGE is one of the worlds leading advanced technology groups, established to develop agile, bold and disruptive solutions for defence and beyond, and to be a catalyst for change and transformation.

        "article text": "After three of Germanys top players  Stephan Jäger, Martin Kaymer and Matti Schmid  confirmed their spots in the 2025 BMW International Open in December, two international stars have now also been announced, namely the two Masters champions Sergio García (2017) and Patrick Reed (2018). García will tee off at Germanys only current DP World Tour tournament for the 14thtime this year, while Reed is making only his second appearance in Munich.\nThe two exceptional golfers have also made their mark in the Ryder Cup. With 28.5 points, the 45-year-old Spaniard is the most successful player in the history of the legendary team competition, while the 34-year-old American earned himself the nickname Captain America as the emotive leader of Team USA. Reeds singles match against Rory McIlroy (NIR) at the 2016 Ryder Cup in Hazeltine (USA) is unforgettable and is regarded as the best one ever played in the competition to date.\nGarcía last teed off at the BMW International Open in 2022. Despite an extremely successful career with 16 titles on the DP World Tour and eleven wins on the PGA TOUR, he is yet to win in Munich. He has finished second twice (2011 and 2017) and, together with Pablo Larrazábal, became one of the sporting highlights of the tournaments 36-year history in 2011. Over five extra holes, the two Spaniards went head-to-head in a play-off that was both dramatic and top class, and one that those who had the privilege of witnessing live will no doubt never forget.\nIm really looking forward to returning to the BMW International Open. This tournament and the golf fans, who have always given me their whole-hearted support there, have always meant a great deal to me, said García. I love Munich and am looking forward to competing with a first-class international field, particularly the top German players.\nReed made his debut at the BMW International Open last year and finished in joint 13thplace. After three rounds the Texan was just two shots behind the leader but was unable to exploit that good starting point on the final Sunday. However, Reed still has very fond memories of the week in Munich.\nI am so excited to announce that I will be back in Munich this summer to tee it up in the 2025 BMW International Open. I played in the historic BMW International for the first time last year, and we had such a great time  the competitive spirit and atmosphere, the Bavarian culture, and crowd makes for such a great event! I look forward to coming back and experiencing that again this year, said Reed. I love to play courses with a lot of history, with great winners from both sides of the pond, that truly gives players a proper and fair test. Like all BMW events, this tournament is rich in tradition with outstanding organizations that support this great event and great fans who love great golf! BMW, The DP World Tour, and the tournament staff, make this event so special. We cant wait to be back!\nTickets for the BMW International Open are available to buy online in the ticket shop (www.bmw-golfsport.com/tickets). Entry to the Pro-Am tournament (Wednesday, 2nd July 2025) is free. Children aged 14 and under can also enjoy free admission on all other days.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/334381/334381-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334381\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

In total, more than 25,000 fans attended the BADDEST BEHAVIOUR concept tour.\nNiels Walboomers, President, Records and Publishing, Benelux, WMG, says: Were incredibly excited to be welcoming Mau P to WCM Benelux.

After her sensational performance at the Australian Open, Eva Lys has been given a wild card by the organisers.\nIt was a dreamlike start to the season for Eva Lys. At the years first Grand Slam, the 23-year-old German battled her way into the fourth round  the first womens singles lucky loser to ever go so far  and into the hearts of the Melbourne fans. Spectators at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix can watch the former Porsche Talent Team player this year. Thanks to a wild card, she will be in the main draw of the world-class tournament in the Porsche Arena for the second time since 2022.\nEvas great performance at the Australian Open delighted the fans.

        "article text": "The quest for the most profound emotions, universal passions and the Italian spirit are the heart of the collaboration between Alfa Romeo and Noemi, one of the most beloved voices on the Italian music scene.  At the 75thSanremo Festival, the singer thrilled the audience with the song Se tinnamori muori, speaking of the courage to abandon oneself to love and fully experience emotions, even those that make us more vulnerable.\nAlfa Romeo identifies with the style and expressive force the artist manages to convey in her own unique way through her songs, especially the track in competition at the Italian Song Festival.  The brand therefore decided that its new compact sports car, the Alfa Romeo Junior, would join Noemi in the music video*for Se tinnamori muori. The car opens and closes the piece, as if a silent witness to the emotions of the artist who, on a journey with herself, finally welcomes the feeling of love, without fear or masks. Conversely, emotions are an essential value for Alfa Romeo: often in contrast with current trends that veer towards minimalist simplification, Alfa Romeo experiences the journey and the relationship between human and car with an emotional involvement that can sometimes be romantic, for which the car is not just a means of transport but forms a veritable symbiosis.\nA new album and a unique showThe song Noemi sang at the Sanremo Festival will be on her new album,Nostalgia, to be released on February 28, 2025. At the end of this year, the singer-songwriter will take to the stage of the Palazzo dello Sport in Rome for the first time with a unique show on December 20, 2025, after performing in Italian theaters in November and December.\n*Music video produced by Sony Music Entertainment Italy S.p.A.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/334375/334375-1.png)\nWebWireID334375\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "The National Football League announced today the finalists in the seventh annual Big Data Bowl, the leagues crowd-sourcing competition for the sports analytics community aimed at challenging applicants to use Next Gen Stats (NGS) to generate insights to enhance the game. Each finalist received $12,500 for being selected.\nPowered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), this years competition highlighted data collected from what happens before the snap to produce insights and actionable predictions into what the offense or defense does after the snap. Additionally, Pro Football Focus (PFF) scouting data was included to help identify formations, wide receiver routes and blocking assignments. Using this data, each contestant was placed in one of three tracks: design a metric, coaching presentation and undergraduate students. More than 400 data scientists from around the world participated in this years event  a record high for the Big Data Bowl competition.\nEach year we see an incredible rise in participants as well as skill levels, reflecting a growing appetite to explore new aspects of football, said Mike Lopez, senior director of football data and analytics at the NFL. This years competition highlighted the increasing importance of pre-snap tendencies in scouting and play design, uncovering fascinating ways teams conceal their plays. The NFL continues to be inspired by the innovation and talent emerging from this competition and their impact on the future of the game.\nThe 2025 Big Data Bowl will culminate with an in-person event at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis on Feb. 26. Each of the finalists will be competing for an additional $12,500 in prize money, and the event will feature a keynote discussion by Dr. Eric Tulsky, general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes.

        "article text": "Simon & Schuster announced today that it will publish a posthumous book by David McCullough, one of the nations most decorated historians, winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, two National Book Awards, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. HISTORY MATTERS is a timely collection of McCulloughs essays that address the importance of history, especially our shared history as Americans. Many of these essays have never been published, and the collection will include a foreword by Jon Meacham. The book is edited by McCulloughs daughter Dorie McCullough Lawson and his longtime researcher, Michael Hill, and it publishes on September 16, 2025.\nOver the course of his distinguished storytelling career, David McCullough emphatically showed the public why history matters. Now, at a time of self-reflection in America following an election that has left the country divided, his essays explore core American values to which we all subscribe, regardless of which region we live in, which political party we identify with, or how our backgrounds differvalues like optimism, determination, and character. The book also shares McCulloughs advice about writing along with his own early influences and inspirations. The essays are vintage McCullough: beautifully written, thought-provoking, and exhibiting the endless curiosity of their author. Perhaps most importantly, they present lessons in how we cannot understand history unless we see events as the participants saw them, not knowing the outcome. That approach to history informs readers how we might navigate our current moment.\nIt has been an honor to work with my fathers writings in the years since his death, said Dorie McCullough Lawson. My mother, Rosalee, always said that his work was built to last, and it has been reassuring to see how right she was. What comes through most clearly in this collection are the themes of his optimism, integrity, careful study, independence, creativity, hard work, and love of country.\nDavid McCullough was a beloved Simon & Schuster author for more than fifty years. It is an honor to be able to publish him one more time, said Jonathan Karp, President and Chief Executive Officer of Simon & Schuster. The artistry of his writing and the depth of his appreciation for the lessons of history are timeless.\nKarp acquired world, audio, and first serial rights from Anne Sibbald of Janklow & Nesbit Associates. Bob Bender, executive editor emeritus, edited the book. The books jacket art includes a photo of David McCullough at the Truman Library.\nDavid McCullough(19332022) twice received the Pulitzer Prize, forTrumanandJohn Adams, and twice received the National Book Award, forThe Path Between the SeasandMornings on Horseback. His other acclaimed books includeThe Johnstown Flood,TheGreat Bridge,Brave Companions,1776,The Greater Journey,The American Spirit,The Wright Brothers, andThe Pioneers. He was the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nations highest civilian award. VisitDavidMcCullough.com.Dorie McCullough Lawsonis David McCulloughs daughter and worked with him for nearly three decades. She is the author of three previous books, includingPosterity: Letters of Great Americans to Their Children.Michael Hillis an independent historical researcher who worked with David McCullough for over thirty years. He is also the author of three previous books, including a biography of Elihu Washburne. He served as a historical consultant for the HBO production of David McCulloughsJohn Adams.\nSimon & Schuster, a global leader in general interest publishing, is dedicated to providing the best in fiction and nonfiction for readers of all ages, and in all printed, digital and audio formats.

        "article text": "Alstom Foundation seeks strategic partnerships that generate lasting social impact.\nAlstom Foundationannounces the awarding of funding to Instituto Reciclar to support a project that aims to promote the economic inclusion of 330 young people between the ages of 15 and 19 from the Jaguaré community in São Paulo. The partnership will last 16 months and coincides with a significant milestone for Instituto Reciclar, which in 2025 will complete 30 years of work dedicated to the productive inclusion of young people in vulnerable situations.\nWith the support of Alstom Foundation, Instituto Reciclar will significantly expand the reach of its educational program in 2025. 180 new young people will take part in the training, doubling the number of 90 participants in 2024. Considering the three modules of the program, the total number of people served will increase from 220 to 330, marking an important step forward in the mission to reduce social inequalities and create opportunities for young people in vulnerable situations.\nWith the support of Alstom Foundation, Instituto Reciclar will significantly expand the reach of its educational program in 2025. 180 new young people will take part in the training, doubling the number of 90 participants in 2024. Considering the three modules of the program, the total number of people served will increase from 220 to 330, marking an important step forward in the mission to reduce social inequalities and create opportunities for young people in vulnerable situations.\nThe project helps participants develop technical and socio-emotional skills, essential for their professional careers. The technical stage of the program includes in-person workshops on design thinking, life projects and tutoring in mathematics, Portuguese and English. The socio-emotional module works on skills such as creativity, teamwork, communication and proactivity.\nIn the second stage, the focus turns to professional training, with technical training in leading schools and access to an online educational platform, which complements learning with the development of cognitive skills and proficiency in English. Finally, the program works to insert young people into the job market, connecting them to employment and internship opportunities at partner companies. This approach aims not only to prepare young people for the market, but also to empower them to build a solid and sustainable career.\nAlstom Foundation seeks strategic partnerships that generate lasting social impact. This project, in collaboration with Instituto Reciclar, demonstrates our commitment to investing in local communities, empowering young people and contributing to the economic and social development of São Paulo\", says Ana Caiasso, Alstoms Director of Communications and Corporate Social Responsibility for Latin America.\nIn this significant year for Instituto Reciclar, in which we celebrate 30 years of operation, we are honored to have the partnership of Alstom Foundation to transform the lives of young people. The partnership is in line with the growth in the number of young people impacted by the Educational Program, offering more opportunities for the qualified and sustainable insertion of young people into the job market. Together, we are building new paths and opening doors to a promising future for young people in vulnerable situations\" says Carlos Henrique de Lima, Executive Director of Instituto Reciclar.\nThe initiative seeks to expand study and employability opportunities for young Brazilians. In 2023, according to data from the Ministry of Labors Undersecretariat for Statistics and Studies, 7.1 million young people between the ages of 14 and 24 neither studied nor worked, 60% of whom were women, the majority with young children, and 68% were black or brown. The same study indicates that 38% of young women and 46% of unemployed young adults did not complete secondary education. Faced with this scenario, education, training and professional integration initiatives are essential to offer young people a promising path to development and professional qualification, helping to build a more prosperous and inclusive future.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334367/334367-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334367\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Female Wellness programs are the latest example of the Six Senses integrated wellness philosophy. With a focus on perimenopause, menopause, and holistic female well-being, each bespoke 3-, 5- or 7-day Female Wellness journey is designed to empower women with the insights and tools to keep their hormones and metabolism balanced through times of transition and during their monthly cycle.\nWithin the space and calm of Six Senses properties and away from the demands and distractions of everyday life, guests are invited to explore the connection, science, and wisdom of the female body. This includes support on female hormone cycles, fasting, blood sugar science and measurement, body composition changes, and sexual wellness. A non-invasive Wellness Screening measures key biometric markers, whereafter Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) is used throughout the program to track the guests blood sugar levels as they follow fasting principles in harmony with their hormonal cycle.\nFive properties are amongst the first to offer Female Wellness programs with other Six Senses around the world to follow suit in the coming months.\nAnna Bjurstam, Six Senses Wellness Pioneer, says: Women have an immense power within themselves. TheSix Senses Female Wellness journey is designed to equip guests with the tools and techniques to regain ownership of their bodys natural rhythms through times of change. The programs create space over a few days or even a whole week for women to introduce these principles to their way of life. Its about unlocking the untapped potential within us to enable women to thrive wherever they are in their cycle or life stage. Tuning in to the bodys language and adapting eating behaviors and movement patterns can help women navigate symptoms of the menopause such as mood swings, weight problems, and brain fog. Dr. Mindy is a fountain of female knowledge. Working together, we hope to bring our shared expertise to more and more women around the world. Particularly as the data shows how information on the menopause isnt reaching women.\nThe World Economic Forum1recognizes the gender health gap, with one key area being the lack of persistent data on female hormones and health, and the lack of available data reaching women. Six Senses Female Wellness programs aim to inform and empower women, specifically around key issues of nutrition, movement, sleep, stress and mindset, and lifestyle.\nGuided by the Six Senses mission to help guests reconnect with themselves, others, and the world around them, Female Wellness programs are an invitation to women to tune into what their body is telling them. They harness the knowledge of Dr. Mindy Pelz, a bestselling author and advocate of holistic wellness approaches.\nDr. Mindy Pelzsays:All that I do is about giving women the power back when it comes to their health. There are lifechanging tools within us that are massively underutilized. Often, we take our well-being for granted until we find ourselves in a state of discomfort or imbalance, such as when approaching or going throughthe menopause. But when we bring our bodies back into alignment with our own biology, we can unlock all that our body is capable of. Its a joy to be able to work together with Six Senses to help women increase their confidence and outlook during this turbulent life stage. Its about enabling women to thrive not just survive.\nIntegrated Wellness Practitioners at each Six Senses property devise a unique plan for each guest, informed by their Wellness Screening at the beginning of their stay. Thereafter, a combination of holistic and locally inspired treatments, therapies, and activities aim to relax the nervous system and support the oxytocin boost stimulated by fasting.\nPrograms adopt the Six Senses high-tech, high-touch approach to wellness with Sleep With Six Senses and Eat With Six Senses principles incorporated into the stay. Every guest room is optimized for sleep, from the handmade mattresses by Naturalmat to the organic pillow menu and bedding on top. A sleep tracker or sleep tracking ring can be arranged on a complimentary basis to measure a wide range of metrics throughout the program. Results are analyzed during a sleep review to pinpoint any changes that may need to be made for the following night.\nIn keeping with Mindys teaching, guests will follow a fasting program in sync with their cycle. Those embarking on a menopause or perimenopause program will cycle between fasting, ketosis, and hormone-stimulating foods with a focus on healthy carbohydrates and fibers. All foods follow the three guiding principles of Eat With Six Senses: natural ingredients, local and sustainable, and less is more. This philosophy  where food is as nutritious as it is delicious  means guests enjoy food and drink that leaves them feeling better than when they arrived. Menus take a cleaner and simpler approach to preparation, focusing on quality, balance and fresh whole food made from scratch. Produce is often grown within the organic gardens and mushroom hubs of Six Senses properties and in some locations, the eggs and milk come from onsite farms.\nThe three-day program explores the foundations of hormonal and metabolic health. The extended five-day program allows for a deeper exploration of the key factors that influence hormonal balance, mood, cravings, sleep, weight, and mental clarity. The seven-day program aims to forge longstanding connections between fasting, food, exercise, self-care, and hormonal balance and places a greater emphasis and intention on weight release, metabolic flexibility, and detox principles that can support long-term hormonal health and overall well-being once home.\nThere are several videos to watch recorded by Dr. Mindy Pelz that introduce the approach and tools, the rhythm of menstrual and hormone cycles, and how exercise and fasting should follow suit, how fasting affects sex hormones, fertility, key transitions during menopause, journaling, repairing the microbiome, and essential lifestyle changes to make after 40. Women can continue to walk the path to improved wellness after they check out by joining Mindys Reset Academy forum.\nSix Senses will introduce Female Wellness programs to five properties this year Six Senses Douro Valley, Six Senses Rome, Six Senses Kanuhura, Six Senses Ninh Van Bay and Six Senses Crans-Montana with a view to extending them to all Six Senses properties thereafter. They will be available year-round and can be followed as a solo traveler or as part of a group or family trip.

        "article text": "Fonterra has today announced new funding designed to build a stronger Co-operative and continue to grow value for its shareholders through helping farmers reduce on-farm emissions.\nFor the 2025/26 season beginning on 1 June, Fonterra will introduce a payment for farms that achieve certain emissions-related criteria as part of updates to itsCo-operative Differenceframework.\nMeanwhile, new incentives that benefit farmers will be funded through separate agreements with Mars and Nestlé, who have been working with Fonterra to make progress towards their individual sustainability goals by supporting farmers to reduce emissions.Fonterra CEO Miles Hurrell says the new incentives demonstrate Fonterras strategy in action.Were growing relationships with customers who value the hard work farmers put into producing sustainable, high-quality milk, along with the Co-ops quality of on-farm data and ongoing commitment to improvement. This helps us make progress towards achieving our on-farm emissions target and deliver the highest returns for our farmer shareholders milk.\nLast year we confirmed six strategic choices that we believe will help grow further value in the years ahead and this is an example of how were delivering on two of those choices, deliver the strongest farmer offering and build on our sustainability position, says Mr Hurrell.The new funding includes:New Co-operative Difference payment\n1-5 cent per kgMS payment:To date, a total of up to 10 cents per kilogram of milk solids (kgMS) has been possible across all achievements within Fonterras Co-operative Difference framework. A new Emissions Excellence achievement will offer a further payment of between 1-5 cents per kgMS for farms that meet certain criteria*. Based on last seasons data, its estimated that approximately 5,000 farms will be eligible for this payment next season.\nNew customer incentives\nFunding from separate agreements with Mars and Nestlé, will be split between:\nMars Snacking Chief R&D, Procurement and Sustainability Officer, Amanda Davies says between new equipment and technology, embracing more sustainable practices comes with a price tag for farmers.\nThats why were working with partners like Fonterra to help remove this barrier  providing cash, tools, and technology to support farmers in making meaningful, long-term changes.Nestlé New Zealand CEO, Jennifer Chappell, says Nestlé globally is a significant purchaser of New Zealand dairy ingredients, and dairy remains its largest source of greenhouse gas emissions.As we strive towards achieving net zero emissions by 2050, we are committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions. We will continue to support farmers, in partnership with Fonterra, fostering new economic opportunities and helping them lower their greenhouse gas emissions.Mars and Nestlé have independently supported Fonterra farmers with their sustainability actions through initiatives introduced over the past couple of seasons.\nIn 2024, Fonterra farmers were invited to take part in the Mars Tools and Services pilot, which provided access to tools and services, including animal efficiency services and digital tools. Additionally, Mars previously supported the Greener Choices programme, which made it easier for Fonterra farmers to identify and buy products at Farm Source stores that could help them make sustainability improvements on-farm.In 2022, Fonterra and Nestlé announced a partnership that included theNet Zero Pilot Dairy Farmin Taranaki, designed to help reduce on-farm emissions. In 2023, Fonterra announced that Nestlé would make an additional payment of between 1-2 cents per kgMS for farms that achieved any level of the Co-operative Difference. This payment has been replaced with the new Emissions Incentive payment from next season.\nNotes\n*New Co-operative Difference payment\nTo meet the new Emissions Excellence achievement, farmers need to achieve the Co-operative Difference and their emissions from farming activities (like feed, fertiliser and herd) minus any carbon removals (i.e. emissions reductions resulting from the carbon dioxide that is removed from trees and vegetation that is grown on-farm) need to be lower than the Co-ops 2017/18 baseline year.\n**Extra 10-25 cents per kgMS Emissions Incentive paymentTo receive the customer-funded Emissions Incentive payment, farmers need to achieve the Co-operative Difference and have one of the lowest emissions footprints in the Co-op (around 30% lower than the average farm). This will take into account not only emissions from farming activities, but also those associated with land use change (e.g. the historical conversion of forests to pasture) and those released from peat soils, before subtracting any carbon removals.\nFonterras Climate RoadmapFonterra has a target of reducing on-farm emissions intensity by 30% by 2030 from a 2018 baseline. The target was announced in 2023 as part of itsClimate Roadmap, which outlines the Co-ops 2030 targets and ambition to be net zero by 2050. This target is critical for a number of reasons. It helps the Co-op to remain competitive and build stronger partnerships with customers as well as be able to secure future funding, meet market access demands and comply with increased legal and reporting obligations, as the Co-op plays its part in taking action on climate change.Sustainability at MarsAs part of Mars Net Zero Roadmap, the company has built a plan to halve full value chain emissions by 2030*, enroute to Net Zero by 2050. Mars is already delivering on its promises with 16% absolute reductions in GHG emissions in 2023 against a 2015 baseline, across its full value chain.\nIn 2024, Mars launched its Mooving Dairy Forward plan, a $47M 3-year investment in new technologies and partnerships to slash greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its global dairy supply chain.\n*As measured against a 2015 baseline.Sustainability at NestléNestlé is striving towards net zero emissions by 2050. In 2020, they published the global Nestlé Net Zero Roadmap and have since transformed their business to start delivering reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across all three Scopes of their activities. By the end of 2025, Nestlé aims to reduce emissions by 20% and by the end of 2030, by 50%.Progress toward net zero will be measured against Nestlés 2018 GHG emissions.

In addition, they have managed to develop the hydrogen storage system that validates their project and are preparing to make the first real pilots.\nIn the third edition, the winning project was Utopia, an initiative to detect and stop the spread of fires through artificial intelligence. The team members have evolved professionally as a result of the imaginPlanet Challenge and have obtained jobs in China and scholarships at the University of California at Berkeley to continue working on their skills and be able to improve the project.\nIn the last edition, the winning project was Ecova, an integrated system designed to capture, treat and reuse the grey water generated in homes. After the trip to Silicon Valley, the team is focused on designing the Minimum Viable Product to validate its value proposition and set up the company.\nWith the aim of continuing to support the evolution of the projects that have been part of the imaginPlanet Challenge, imagin has an Alumni community so that all participating teams can continue to be linked to the programme.

        "link": "https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=334358",
        "article text": "The United States Postal Service is announcing that Louis DeJoy, Americas 75th Postmaster General, has notified the Postal Service Board of Governors that it is time for them to begin the process of identifying his successor. The Governors of the Postal Service, working with key stakeholders, will now begin the process of identifying an appropriate candidate to serve as the next Postmaster General and Chief Executive Officer of the United States Postal Service.Postmaster Generals letter to the Board of Governors\nLouis DeJoy has steadfastly served the nation and the Postal Service over the past five years, said Amber McReynolds, chairwoman of the Board of Governors. The Governors greatly appreciate his enduring leadership and his tireless efforts to modernize the Postal Service and reverse decades of neglect. She added that Louis is a fighter, and he has fought hard for the women and men of the Postal Service and to ensure that the American people have reliable and affordable service for years to come.\nDeJoy stated, While there remains much critical work to be done to ensure that the Postal Service can be financially viable as we continue to serve the nation in our essential public service mission, I have decided it is time to start the process of identifying my successor and of preparing the Postal Service for this change. The major initiatives we are currently endeavoring are multi-year programs and it is important to have leadership in place whose tenure will span this future period. After four and half years leading one of Americas greatest public institutions through dramatic change during unusual times, it is time for me to start thinking about the next phase of my life, while also ensuring that the Postal Service is fully prepared for the future.\nThe Postal Service has ironclad plans to reduce costs by over $4 billion annually, raise revenue by over $5 billion and adjust its operating network to integrate the delivery of all mail and package categories, achieving service standards that make modern-day sense and compete in the marketplace, DeJoy added. We are well on our way with these necessary changes, and I have been developing a leadership team whose careers reach further into the future than the one we have today. It is important to me that we timely and methodically bring forth a new postmaster general who understands our mission and can successfully lead our spirited organization. I will be flexible in helping with this transition, and I am confident that with a period of dedicated focus preparing for this change, the Postal Service will be well positioned for future success under the new leadership.\nDeJoy continued, I am extremely proud of the 640,000 men and women of the United States Postal Service who live, work and serve in every American community. Despite being victimized by a legislative and regulatory business model that produced almost two decades of devastation to their organization and workplaces, they have persevered and embraced the changes we are making in order to better serve their fellow citizens. It has been one of the pleasures of my life and a crowning achievement of my career to have been associated with them and their mission of public service. I look forward to working with them during my remaining time here.\nDeJoy was first asked to lead the Postal Service in the spring of 2020, a time of tremendous operational and financial crisis for the organization. After many years of strategic neglect and underinvestment in people and infrastructure, he took on the responsibility of leading the Postal Service with the understanding that a massive, long-term transformation and modernization effort was needed.\nWithin a year, DeJoy, his team, and the Board of Governors developed a 10-year plan to put the organization on a path toward financial sustainability and operational high performance. The Delivering for America plan gave the organization well-defined strategies to establish a best-in-class operational model to drive network efficiency and capability; business model changes to address unsustainable legislative and regulatory mandates; product and pricing strategies to grow revenue; and investment in people, facilities, vehicles and technology to create more effective and modern workplaces.\nWhile only four years into the implementation of the10-year Delivering for America plan, the strategic path is well defined, and the strategies have been tested and proven effective, and the results to date are impressive. Importantly, the Postal Service successfully undertook the most complicated of ventures  a top-to-bottom organizational transformation  and done so quickly and on an unprecedented scale, while also delivering mail and packages at least six days per week to more than 168 million delivery addresses each day.\nUnder DeJoys tenure, this disruptive transformation changed practically every process, function and operation of the Postal Service for the better. DeJoy acknowledged that the essential need for change, given the critically distressed financial and operational conditions of the Postal Service, caused service issues for the American people that he wished could have been avoided, but also recognized that the transformation was vitally necessary for the Postal Service to not only survive, but also thrive.  This effort created a new management structure; installed much of a new processing, logistics and delivery network design; invested more than $18 billion to modernize infrastructure; created new products and more rational pricing; and enabled the organization to compete more effectively and to operate at a long-term lower cost.  During this massive transformation and modernization effort, the Postal Service distributed COVID test kits, delivered the nations election mail, met the annual holiday shipping needs of the public, and served the American public every day. These efforts resulted in $1 billion in controllable income and $140 million in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) income, rather than losses, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nI commend Postmaster General DeJoy for inspiring the Postal Service with strategic direction, a competitive spirit, and a culture of achievement that comes from the successful implementation of large-scale change, said McReynolds. I have seen this spirit of purpose grow steadily during my time on the Board of Governors, and I am confident it will continue to grow as progress begets further progress, and the promise of a transformed and modernized Postal Service is fully realized.\nThe United States Postal Service is an independent federal establishment, mandated to be self-financing and to serve every American community through the affordable, reliable and secure delivery of mail and packages to 169 million addresses six and often seven days a week. Overseen by a bipartisan Board of Governors, the Postal Service is implementing a 10-year transformation plan,Delivering for America, to modernize the postal network, restore long-term financial sustainability, dramatically improve service across all mail and shipping categories, and maintain the organization as one of Americas most valued and trusted brands.\nThe Postal Service generally receives no tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations.\nFor USPS media resources, including broadcast-quality video and audio and photo stills, visit theUSPS Newsroom.

        "article text": "Accor today announced the release of a new white paper that will shape the future of the hospitality industry, ushering in a new era of spa and wellness design.Making Waves: Rethinking Spa and Wellness Design for a Modern Erashares the priorities for well-being that Accor believes are most relevant now and how the global hospitality group is advancing innovative ways to deliver wellness through its unrivalled portfolio of global hospitality brands. The thought-provoking report leverages the insights, predictions and analysis garnered from a symposium held by Accors Global Well-being, Strategy, Design, and Development team, and features perspectives from Accor specialists and renowned industry experts around the world. Based on this collaborative forum,Making Waves,the white paper, explores the future of the wellness industry while touching on key consumer shifts and trends.\nWellness has become a leading driver and differentiator for us, particularly in the areas of luxury and lifestyle design. It is also an exciting area of design thattouches the hearts and lifts the spirits of our guests more profoundly than almost any other aspect of the hotel experience,saysAnne Becker Olins, Global Chief Design & Technical Services Officer  Ultra Luxury & Luxury, Accor.WithMaking Waves, we aim to educate, inspire and innovate the ways in which the hospitality industry approaches wellness and well-being design.\nAccors research of 7,500 consumers across six countries revealed that wellness is a priority for 79 percent of its guests. This dovetails with the findings of industry experts, such asSkifts 2023 Luxury Traveler Survey, which found 80 percent of travelers say well-being influences their travel decisions. Furthermore, according toISPAs 2024 spa-goer survey, Spa memberships are emerging as a significant trend in the wellness and hospitality industries, driven by a growing societal desire for self-care, relaxation and holistic well-being.\nOne of the themes explored inMaking Waves, is the shift toward membership clubs among hotel spas and fitness clubs. This is supported by Accors own push to lead the industry in building hotels not just for travelers, but for its local communities.\nWe are approaching spa design in the same way - for the people who live next door or who work down the street. We are creating clubs, thermal facilities, wellness centers, and fitness offerings that are on par, or better, than the local gym. Our hotel spas are where the locals want to go to get fit, to be social, and to feel better,saysEmlyn Brown, Global SVP of Well-being, Strategy, Design, and Development at Accor.\nMaking Wavesexplores how thermal wellness - such as the highly anticipatedBASIN Glacial Watersfacility set to open Summer 2025 at Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise - and wellness socializing are revolutionizing the delivery of spa and fitness in the hospitality industry. The rise of hot and cold plunge circuits reflects a rapidly growing consumer interest in holistic wellness and natural therapies, which are evident in Accor concepts likeThe Purist. At the same time, a new generation of spa-goers are enthusiastically pursuing social wellness experiences such as group bathing, sauna, and water-based therapy clubs as healthier alternatives to socializing in bars or nightclubs.\nOther areas of content in the white paper include:\nHoteliers around the world are shifting their focus to define their wellness strategies, ensuring they align with their brands and their guest demographics,addsBrown.It is our hope and intention that the insights weve gathered inMaking Waveswill support these efforts, as we all seek to create more impactful wellness spaces and places.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334353/334353-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334353\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Lufthansa Airlines is further expanding its premium service for its passengers.\nIn cooperation with the technology provider AirPortr, Lufthansa Airlines is now offering all travelers departing from Frankfurt a new and innovative baggage collection and check-in service. The offer is as simple as it is convenient: guests can have their suitcases and bags picked up at home or at their hotel. The luggage is then sealed, brought securely to the airport and checked in there. Travelers receive real-time updates via a personalized tracking link and a digital baggage tag receipt. Passengers can therefore travel to the airport without having to carry heavy check-in luggage and go straight to the security checkpoint  they only collect their luggage again at their destination.\nThe new premium service saves time, is convenient and makes it easier to travel, especially by public transport.\nInterested guests can now book the new offer onlufthansa.comup to 36 hours before departure. It is available to customers from the greater Frankfurt, Mannheim, Heidelberg, Hanau, Aschaffenburg, Wiesbaden, Mainz, Darmstadt and Bensheim areas. Further expansion is planned in the near future. The service is available from as little as 25 euros, with prices varying depending on location and pick-up time.\nWe aim to continuously improve the overall travel experience of our guests and further expand our premium services  both during the flight and on the ground, says Heiko Reitz, Chief Customer Officer Lufthansa Airlines. With the new pick-up and check-in service, we are offering our passengers another exclusive service that is unique in Germany. We are making the journey easier from the very first minute.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334352/334352-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334352\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Higher education has expanded massively over the past two decades. More students than ever are enrolling, with global higher education enrollment jumping from 19% in 2000 to 43% in 2023. But here is the catch: more students in university does not automatically mean more students graduating. In fact, the graduation rate has only gone up from 17% to 26% in the same period and the share of graduates that land good jobs is even smaller. That is a big gap that requires careful consideration by universities and policymakers alike.\nThere are several reasons for this. One is related to the rising number of skills mismatches between higher education and the demands of the workforce. A diploma alone does not guarantee a smooth career path anymore. For example, digital skills are in huge demand, but universities can be slow to update their curricula to such realities.\nIn addition, economic growth has not kept up with the rising number of graduates in several countries. In lower-income countries especially, this has led to too many qualified people and too few quality jobs. The result? A growing number of graduates stuck in jobs that do not fully use their skills, or worse, struggling to find stable employment or employment at all. These are not the results students expect after investing in university education and at societal level, it does not increase social mobility.\nGovernments are paying attention. About 70% of national higher education plans now highlight employability as a priority. But universities need to play their part too: it is not just about getting students through to graduation, it is about making sure they leave with the right skills and opportunities. An increasing number of universities are adapting course curricula to meet industry demands, for example, by promoting entrepreneurship to prepare graduates for a gig economy or integrating practical experiences such as internships and cooperative education programs into the degree. But also, universities are strengthening career services to mentor students and connect them with employers.\nStill, theres a missing piece: not all students start at the same place. For those from underrepresented backgrounds, finding a quality job after graduation is even more complicated. Universities need to ensure their career services are cognizant of this fact.\nUnderrepresented students vary among world regions but often include those from low socio-economic backgrounds, refugees, Indigenous peoples, first-generation college attendees, and individuals with disabilities. Career building activities, such as internships\nand networking opportunities are harder for them to access due to financial constraints, social biases and other structural inequalities.\nTake unpaid internships, for example. These are a common stepping-stone into many industries, but they remain out of reach for students who cannot afford to work for free. Likewise, first-generation college students often lack mentorship and professional networks that can help them navigate career choices or connect with potential employers. Meanwhile, systemic biases in hiring and workplace cultures can create additional barriers, from a lack of awareness of the students unique needs to outright discrimination. Even well-intended employability programs may overlook some aspects like physical accessibility, leaving students with disabilities at a disadvantage.\nSo, what can universities do to level the playing field? A more holistic approach is needed; one that goes beyond general career services to offer comprehensive targeted support in collaboration with other university units and employers. Recognizing this, UNESCO IESALC andLumina Foundationhave collaborated on a new report highlighting 15 innovative and inclusive university initiatives designed to support students from low socio-economic backgrounds, refugee students, Indigenous students and students with disabilities to successfully transition into the workforce. Stay tuned!\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334351/334351-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334351\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": " Telefónica becomes the parent company of the ecosystem that the Government of Biscay has been developing since 2021 to promote quantum technologies through Biqain, Bizkaia Quantum Advanced Industries. Both will analyse, in a session to be held on 4 March at the companys stand at the Mobile World Congress, the importance of public-private collaboration for the advancement of quantum technology at the service of individuals and companies.\nTelefónica España has signed an agreement with the Government of Biscay to become its technology partner and collaborate in the development of its quantum technology industrial strategy in this historic territory.\nThis agreement demonstrates the importance of public-private collaboration in the development of technology, as both parties will analyse in a joint session to be held in the Agora at the Telefónica stand during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It will take place on 4 March at 11:15 a.m., and both Ainara Basurko, Deputy for Economic Promotion of the Government of Biscay, and Patricia Díez, Director of Network and Systems Security at Telefónica, will take part in the session, entitled Quantum technologies and public-private collaboration.\nSince 2021, the Government of Biscay has generated and nurtured a quantum ecosystem made up of universities, technology and research centres, large international technology corporations, companies, startups, clusters, startups and public administrations. As part of the Basque Governments BasQ alliance, Biqains objective is to continue with applied research, technological development and innovation in this field so that companies can carry out projects and experiment with quantum technology.\nTelefónica has been researching quantum solutions for more than ten years on the most stable and advanced quantum network infrastructures in Europe, formed not only by its own industrial ring, in service since 2018, but also by the research infrastructures to which it is connected.\nQuantum technologies are set to revolutionize many aspects of our society and drive breakthroughs in different industries and sectors, from finance, energy or telecommunications, to medicine, mobility, chemistry or advanced manufacturing. The main levers that will allow progress in this direction are quantum computing, with computers that will have the capacity to solve very complex problems that cannot be solved today with traditional computers; quantum communications and cryptography, which bring extremely secure communication methods; and quantum sensors, which can provide hyper-precise measurements.\nThe framework collaboration project between the Government of Biscay and Telefónica will have the latest generation equipment necessary for its development. It will incorporate a Digital Annelaer (DA) provided by Fujitsu, which will be housed in a Telefónica central office in Biscay. This is the first DA hosted in infrastructures outside Japan in history. This quantum computing solution is capable of solving problems of up to 100,000 variables, making use of different quantum phenomena (superposition, entanglement, tunnel effect) to speed up calculations.\nIn addition, it will have a specific platform for quantum emulations. The aim is to be able to emulate the operation of quantum circuits, which is achieved by running software on a classical digital computer based on supercomputing (HPC), thus obtaining several emulation modes: state vector, tensor networks and MPS (Matrix Product State).\nUnder the agreement, Telefónica will provide the parties involved in the project with remote access to Fujitsus quantum computing and emulation platforms. These new platforms will complement those already provided by Telefónica to the Government of Biscay. In this way, Biscay is the place in the world with access to more quantum platforms of different technologies and different manufacturers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), DWave, IBM, IONQ, IQM, Microsoft, OQC, Pascal, qci Quantum Circuits, Qilimanjaro, QUANTINUUM, QuEra and Rigetti.\nAinara Basurko, Biscays Councillor for Economic Promotion, considers that the collaboration between technology and research centers, the university, business initiatives and the Government of Biscay will accelerate the development and commercialization of innovations in quantum technology in the territory. We want companies to experiment in this field.\nManuel Ángel Alonso, Telefónica Spains Northern Territory Director, said: This collaboration with the Government of Biscay seems to us to be a project that is as necessary as it is exciting. Quantum computing is set to change the rules of the game at many levels, which makes it essential to be prepared to face its risks and also to benefit from the opportunity it represents. Alonso stresses that at Telefónica we have been working on quantum computing for more than a decade and collaborating with a public institution committed to technology, such as this one, seems to be the way forward for the benefit of all.\nFor more information:Telefónica at MWC 2025\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334348/334348-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334348\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "In line with its 2030 ambition to decarbonize the hydrogen used in its European refineries, TotalEnergies has signed agreements with Air Liquide to develop two projects in the Netherlands, for the production and delivery of some45,000 tons a yearof green hydrogen produced using renewable power, generated mostly by theOranjeWindoffshore wind farm, developed by TotalEnergies (50%) and RWE (50%). These projects will cut CO2emissions from TotalEnergies refineries in Belgium and the Netherlands by up to450,000 tons a yearand contribute to the European renewable energy targets in transport.\nThe two companies have signed an agreement to set up a joint venture, equally held by TotalEnergies (50%) and Air Liquide (50%), which will build and operate a 250 MW electrolyzer near the Zeeland refinery. This project will enable the production of up to30,000 tons of green hydrogen a year, most of which will be delivered to Zeelands platform. The electrolyzer will be commissioned in 2029 and will cut the sites CO2emissions by up to300,000 tons a year. This project representsa global investment of around 600 millionfor both partners and has made requests for support under European and national subsidy programs. Project funding will also be sought by the partners.\nIn addition, as part of Air Liquides 200 MW ELYgator electrolyzer project located in Maasvlakte (Netherlands), TotalEnergies has signed a tolling agreement for 130 MW to be dedicated to the production of15,000 tons per year of green hydrogenfor the TotalEnergies platform in Antwerp. Under this agreement, TotalEnergies will supply the renewable electrons produced by the OranjeWind project to Air Liquide to be transformed into green hydrogen. The project is expected to be operational by the end of 2027 and will reduce CO2emissions at the Antwerp site by up to150,000 tons per year.\nFollowing the first partnership agreement with Air Liquide to supply the Normandy refinery with green hydrogen, and the agreements to supply the Grandpuits and La Mède biorefineries with renewable hydrogen, the partnership with Air Liquide takes on a new dimension and marks a new step in TotalEnergies ambition to decarbonize the hydrogen consumed by its refineries in Europe by 2030, saidVincent Stoquart, President, Refining & Chemicals at TotalEnergies. By supplying these two electrolyzers with renewable electricity from our offshore wind project in the Netherlands, TotalEnergies is leveraging its positioning as an integrated electricity company.\nFlagship projects such as the ones we are announcing today, will play a key role in reducing emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry and heavy mobility. We are proud to lead the way on European renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production, and to accompany TotalEnergies in their journey to decarbonizing their industrial assets. These two projects will complete the five Air Liquide low carbon units already in operation or construction in Europe. This illustrates our capacity to offer concrete solutions to our customers, to reach our carbon neutrality ambition by 2050, and to support Europes leadership ambition towards decarbonized growth. It also demonstrates the ability of Air Liquide to develop solid business models in the energy field of low carbon hydrogen. saidEmilie Mouren-Renouard, member of the Air Liquide Executive Committee, in charge of Europe operations.\nTotalEnergies is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of producing, converting and supplying energy to its customers. One of the pathways identified by the Company is using low-carbon hydrogen to decarbonize its European refineries, a move that should help reduce its annual CO2emissions by around three million tons by 2030. In order to fully decarbonize the hydrogen used in its European refineries, TotalEnergies has already contracted over 170,000 tons of green hydrogen annually at:La Mède,GrandpuitsandNormandyin France,Leunain Germany and its refineries inBelgium and the Netherlands.\n****\nAbout TotalEnergies\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas and green gases, renewables and electricity.

        "article text": "Rohde & Schwarz is the first company to obtain Global Certification Forum (GCF) test approval for validating the radio resource management (RRM) performance of advanced 5G New Radio (NR) devices. This approval specifically applies to devices operating in 5G NR standalone (SA) mode within FR2 and capable of managing multiple angles of arrival. It enables device manufacturers to certify their products for global compatibility with mobile networks that utilize mmWave frequencies and operate in 5G SA with a real 5G core network (5GC).\nVerifying compliance with critical RRM test cases is increasingly important as wireless 5G routers and customer premises equipment (CPE) gain prominence for fixed wireless access (FWA) applications. These test cases are essential for ensuring a reliable end user experience, especially in challenging network conditions, such as blockages, or at the cell edge.\nAfter the Conformance Agreement Group (CAG) #81 meeting held by GCF in Bangkok January 21 to 23, 2025, it was confirmed that Rohde & Schwarz is currently the only provider offering certification solutions that meet all mandatory test requirements for 5G FR2 RRM, while also supporting the largest number of validated test cases for both RF and RRM in this frequency range. The Rohde & Schwarz 5G mmWave test platform offers a wide range of advanced 5G FR2 non-standalone (NSA) and SA test cases. The platform is built on theCMX5005G network emulator and includes the R&S ATS1800M anechoic chamber series as well as a powerful device under test (DUT) positioner.\nThomas Eyring, Senior Director of Device Certification at Rohde & Schwarz, commented on the milestone, saying: We are proud to take a significant step toward enhanced conformance testing as a pioneer in mobile device testing. Our technology will help ensure the quality and reliability of 5G devices while addressing the challenges in the FR2 frequency range. We are also working on test cases for the upcoming FR3 frequency range, which is expected to play a key role in 6G networks.\nMore information onR&S®TS8980conformance test system from Rohde & Schwarz.\nRohde & Schwarz is striving for a safer and connected world with its Test & Measurement, Technology Systems and Networks & Cybersecurity Divisions. For over 90 years, the global technology group has pushed technical boundaries with developments in cutting-edge technologies. The companys leading-edge products and solutions empower industrial, regulatory and government customers to attain technological and digital sovereignty.

        "article text": "Audi Tradition is presenting a special chapter in Audi history with a new exhibition at the Audi Forum Neckarsulm: the companys rise to the upper mid-size range with the Audi 100. Running until April 30, a total of 17 exhibits from eight generations of the C model series, starting with the Audi 100 from 1968, await visitors on the second floor of the Audi Forum.\nOver the course of its four model generations, theAudi 100won the Golden Steering Wheel five times, the title Car of the Year twice, and was named World Car of the Year by automotive journalists once. The model series success is underscored by the 3.2 million Audi 100s that were sold in total. The premiere of the first Audi 100 in 1968 was preceded by an exciting story, as its development began in secret. Volkswagenwerk AG took over Auto Union GmbH in the mid-1960s and prohibited the Ingolstadt-based company from developing new models. Ludwig Kraus, Technical Director of Auto Union at the time, ignored the order to only work on existing models. He wanted to add a mid-range model to the Audi brand, which had only been reintroduced in 1965 with the first Audi produced after the Second World War. At a time when VW Beetles were rolling off the production line at the Ingolstadt plant, Kraus saw this as the only chance of survival for an independent Auto Union. His courage was rewarded, and he received the green light from Wolfsburg for his Audi 100 study. Production started in 1968, and capacity limits were very quickly reached in Ingolstadt. The Audi 100 production therefore moved to the Neckarsulm plant in 1970. The company sold 800,000 cars with the very first series. Three further generations followed and proved Audis claim ofVorsprung durch Technikwith numerous innovations such as the fully galvanized body, optimized aerodynamics, and highly efficient engines.\nSince 1994, theAudi A6has continued the success story of the Audi 100. Nine variants of the Audi 100 and eight of the Audi A6 are on display in Neckarsulm, with the exhibition rounded off by an Audi RS 6 Avant GT) from 2024. According to curator Stefan Felber, each of the 17 vehicles is distinguished by a special characteristic. In addition to the first one, which founded the ancestry line, visitors will also get to know a globetrotter, a feat of spaciousness, a long one, a sloping one, a connected one, and the supreme one  the latter is theAudi RS 6 Avant GT, which concludes the almost 60-year model series history on display. But, as we know, the model series success story will soon be continued with its ninth generation  the new Audi A6 Avant will be revealed to the world on March 4 at 2 p.m.\nAudi Forum NeckarsulmOpening hours: Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., free admission; guided tours of the exhibition available. The Audi Forum Neckarsulm is closed on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays.

        "article text": "Although temporarily down to just one rider, Honda HRC Progressive continued its 2025 AMA Supercross campaign this weekend in Detroit, with Chance Hymas representing the team in 250SX East. Despite a red flag with only seven seconds on the clock, followed by a staggered restart, Hymas delivered a solid performance, ultimately securing a sixth-place finish. Meanwhile, Hondas satellite teams had decent showings across both classes.\nThe 250SX East Region main event saw Hymas work his way through the field after a mid-pack start. As the clock ticked down, a red flag brought the race to a halt, leading to a staggered restart, and Hymas maintained his position to finish sixth. Meanwhile, after taking the holeshot, Quadlock Honda Racings Carson Mumford ran up front early and went on to finish eighth. Storm Lake Honda Buddy Brooks Racings Henry Miller rounded out the top 10, with Phoenix Racing Hondas Cullin Park in 11th, and TiLube Hondas Trevor Colip finishing 13th.\nWith both Jett and Hunter Lawrence sidelined due to injury, Honda HRC Progressive was absent from the 450SX class in Detroit. However, Phoenix Racing Hondas Dylan Ferrandis led the charge for Honda, securing an eighth-place result. Quadlock Honda Racings Shane McElrath and Joey Savatgy were 12th and 13th, respectively.\nNOTES\nChance Hymas\"Round 2 in Detroit was a step in the right direction.

        "article text": "Bridging the gap between pure club racing and professional customer racing, the latest model version competed in over 550 races last year, achieving 19 overall victories, 80 class wins, and securing 11 championship titles. This mid-engine race car remains a key player across all five continents.\nThe Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport had an impressive start to the 2025 IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge season opener in Daytona, finishing in second place. In an intense battle, Belgian driver Jan Heylen and American Luca Mars narrowly missed victory for Team RS1 by just 0.364 seconds after the four-hour race. The 368 kW (500 PS) mid-engine race car has firmly established itself in the North American motorsports scene and beyond. In 2024, Porsche customer teams claimed titles in the Pro-Am, Silver, and Am classes of the Pirelli GT4 America series, while also winning the GT4 championship in the GT America Powered by AWS series for the German sports car manufacturer.\nMotorsport is and will always be at the core of Porsches brand identity. The 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport is proof of this: it is the most successful GT4 race car we have built to date\" emphasizes Volker Holzmeyer, President and CEO of Porsche Motorsport North America (PMNA). \"It represents a strong commitment to the GT4 category and continues to be versatile in design and engineering, where it is competitive and accessible to drivers and teams from club racing all the way through IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge. Its popularity among our customers reflects those attributes, and we are pleased to support them both in open competition and in one-make racing in the Porsche Sprint Challenge North America and Porsche Endurance Challenge North America\"\nThe 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport, alongside the competition models based on the 911 (Generation 992), is a cornerstone of Porsches customer racing program. Since its debut in the 2022 season, it has consistently delivered top results in sprint and endurance races worldwide. Outside the U.S., national GT4 series champions in Germany, France, Italy, Australia, and Thailand have relied on the versatile Porsche race car. In Germany, W&S Motorsport secured all titles in the 2024 ADAC GT4 Germany series, which  along with the GT4 European Series  ranks among the most prestigious GT4 championships. The German series is contested within the DTM framework and serves as a stepping stone to the top-tier GT3 racing category.\nThe GT4 segment has become a key area for Porsche Motorsport\" explains Michael Dreiser, Director of Sales at Porsche Motorsport. \"With the 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport, we have developed an outstanding race car. It enables our customers to compete in numerous series and championships worldwide, achieving great success. It is also gaining increasing popularity in Porsche one-make series and track day events\"\nThe 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport has solidified its presence in Porsche one-make series. In 2025, six Porsche Sports Cups will feature dedicated GT4 series, while six additional series will integrate it into mixed grids. Endurance races in the Porsche Endurance Challenge will also be held in the Benelux countries, North America, New Zealand and Germany  including on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife. However, the so-called PETN as part of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) still relies on the 313 kW (425 PS) predecessor version with the 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport.\nMore than 1,500 Cayman-based GT4 race cars built by Porsche\nPorsche introduced the Cayman GT4 Clubsport in 2016, based on the 981 generation, as a competitive race car for the then still young GT4 customer racing format. Between 2016 and 2018, 421 units were produced. The successor  based on the 982 Cayman generation  debuted in 2019, with a total production of 510 units. High demand was driven in part by relatively low operating costs, as the combination of durable production-based technology with motorsport-specific components significantly reduced expenses for teams.\nContinuing this tradition, the 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport has been in production since 2022, further enhancing its competitiveness. Its 368 kW (500 PS) 4.0-liter flat-six engine, derived from the current 911 GT3 Cup, delivers nearly 18 percent more power than its 3.8-liter predecessor. Optimized air intake design allows maximum power output at 8,300 rpm  800 rpm higher than before  while peak revs reach 9,000 rpm. Torque has also increased to 465 Nm at 6,000 rpm, compared to 425 Nm at 6,600 rpm in the previous model. These improvements result in a broader and more usable powerband. The vehicle also benefits from significant chassis upgrades, including two-way adjustable dampers with refined characteristics, adjustable anti-roll bars at the front and rear, a high-performance racing brake system, and enhanced aerodynamics.\nIn developing the Clubsport model, we incorporated insights and customer feedback from previous years\" says Michael Dreiser. \"The improved lap-time performance combined with enhanced drivability ensures that our customer teams will continue to have a competitive product for GT4 racing worldwide in the coming years\"\nInnovative use of natural fiber composite materials\nThe first-generation 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport was the first production-based race car to feature body components made from natural fiber composite (NFC) materials. The share of these materials has further increased in the GT4 RS Clubsport model, now extending to the front hood, fenders, aerodynamic elements at the front, doors, rear wing, and steering wheel.\nThe flax-based fibers serve as a potential alternative to carbon fiber composites and are tested in motorsport applications for potential use in production vehicles. Porsche has utilized motorsport for over 70 years as a testbed for new technologies, processes, and materials that later benefit road-going models.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334334/334334-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334334\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Showcasing driving pleasure up to the physical limits is the BMW Groups mission with its new high-performance test vehicle  the BMW Vision Driving Experience. This Vision Vehicle is not destined for series production, but is instead serving as a rolling test rig for drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology developed specially for the Neue Klasse  the next generation of BMW vehicles  and referred to by BMW as the Heart of Joy. The prototype car put the capabilities of the Heart of Joy to the ultimate test of endurance at the BMW Performance Driving Center in Spartanburg, USA. And the company provided exclusive insights into its development programme for the electric driving experience on board the Neue Klasse as part of a preview presentation. Every fully electric Neue Klasse model will benefit from the Heart of Joy. The first taller Neue Klasse electric model will go into series production later this year at Plant Debrecen in Hungary. The new Heart of Joy adds a fourth dimension  BMWs hallmark Sheer Driving Pleasure  to the existing trio of Neue Klasse characteristics (electrical, digital, circular). Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, took to the stage at the IAA 2023 show holding the small black box. It is important to note that the control unit will go into series production, but the Vision Vehicle will not.\nThe Heart of Joy enables us to take driving pleasure not just to the next level, but another one beyond that, says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development. In addition, we are further increasing efficiency, and therefore boosting range, as in future the driver will brake almost exclusively using energy regeneration. This is Efficient Dynamics squared.\nComputer processing now ten times faster\nThe Heart of Joy control unit for the drivetrain, brakes, charging, recuperation and steering subfunctions processes information ten times faster than previous systems. Working in tandem with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software, the Heart of Joy computes all the driving dynamics functions with a whole new level of speed and precision. The software has been developed entirely in-house on the back of experience in the field of driving dynamics amassed by BMW engineers over more than a century. The Vision Vehicle develops 18,000 Newton metres (13,269 lb-ft) of torque. The reasoning behind this is that if the control system can deal with an explosion of power of this magnitude, it will be able to handle the demands of everyday driving with ease.\nEnergy recovery under braking (also known as recuperation) sees the drivetrain and braking functions of electric vehicles forming a symbiosis. In the innovative electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy is one of four central control units and combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions for the first time. These innovative control functions are protected by several patent applications. The high-performance unit controls acceleration and braking, vehicle stabilisation, dynamic steering functions and charging management. The central processing unit and perfectly coordinated BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed in-house enable all connected actuators to respond directly and with minimal delay: latencies are in the millisecond range. By contrast, conventional systems have separate control algorithms for the drive system and brakes. This means the full handling potential of vehicles with powerful electric drive systems cannot be fully exploited.\nPrecise cornering and the smoothest stopping process in the history of the car\nThe driver and passengers here experience a harmonious and noiseless driving feeling  regardless of the situation and speed they are travelling at. In dynamic driving scenarios, the new Heart of Joy / BMW Dynamic Performance Control combination serves up cornering poise and assurance beyond compare. The car generates impressive traction and can be threaded through corners with exceptional precision. Fewer control inputs are required and the cars line can be maintained with greater precision and stability. This helps the car to develop consistent, reproducible cornering behaviour and allows it to be steered more intuitively and smoothly. At low speeds  such as in stop-start driving or when parking  direct signal transmissions and rapid information processing ensure an even more compelling driving experience. In driving modes D or B, or when using Active Cruise Control, the parking brake or parking lock, stopping and restarting merge seamlessly into one another.\nRecuperation fuels a 25 per cent increase in efficiency\nFurthermore, integrated drivetrain, braking and energy recuperation control allows energy to be used more sustainably. 98 per cent of drivers do not need to make any inputs using the conventional brakes. The braking power generated using energy recuperation is sufficient for normal, everyday driving. Only under heavy braking, e.g. in an emergency situation, is intervention required from the friction brakes. All in all, this system increases efficiency by up to 25 per cent.\nThe BMW Vision Driving Experience test vehicle demonstrates how the Heart of Joy works using illuminating colour codes on the wheel rims: acceleration is indicated in green, energy recuperation in blue and braking using the friction brakes in orange.\nFour totally new super-brains will go to work in the BMW of the future. These high-performance computers cleverly combine various elements that previously ran separately. The Heart of Joy was developed 100 percent within the company. It allows four important control units to be brought together within a single high-performance computer.\nAnother three super-brains are responsible for features including automated and highly automated driving, infotainment and basic functions such as climate control and comfort-enhancing systems, vehicle access, interior and exterior lighting.\nWorld Premiere at Shanghai Auto Show\nThe BMW Vision Driving Experience will celebrate its official world premiere at Auto Shanghai 2025.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334333/334333-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334333\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

The amount extorted was set to increase monthly beginning in April 2024, to pressure Bachiashvili to capitulate sooner, or else to pay more for the case to go away. This nefarious scheme, not denied by Ivanishvili, highlights, according to Transparency,the extent of Ivanishvilis influence, including over the administration of justice.Indeed, according to Transparency, the countrys prosecution and judiciary arein the service of Ivanishvilis private interestsin the case. Ivanishvili has not onlycaptured all state institutionsand isexerting unilateral control over thembut has alsoderailed Georgias Euro-Atlantic futureand left the countryvulnerable to Russia,Transparency said.Robert Amsterdam, founding partner of Amsterdam & Partners LLP, whorecently denouncedthe rigged show trial ordered by Ivanishvili, and called for strengthened sanctions against Georgia, welcomed Transparencys statement. The renowned human rights lawyer said:Transparency is one of the most respected NGOs in the world, and I hail their courage both for openly observing my clients trial, and for speaking the truth to power in Georgia.Earlier in 2025, Amsterdam & Partners published a new paper,Countdown: How to Hold Bidzina Ivanishvili Accountable for his Assault on Democracy, His Kleptocratic Theft of Georgias Euro-Atlantic Future, and the Show Trial against George Bachiashvili.The paper, which serves as an afterword to the May 2024 white paper on the Bachiashvili case, contains testimony from former members of the Georgian judiciary who accuse Ivanishvili of manipulating the judicial system for his own private interests, including via the so-calledClan of Judges,who were sanctioned by the US government in 2023.Countdowncan be downloaded atwww.bidzinaslaw.comand more information about the firm is available atwww.amsterdamandpartners.com.Transparency Internationals statement is available athttps://transparency.ge.Amsterdam & Partners LLP is an international law firm with offices in London and Washington DC.

Speaking at the inaugural session of Bali Ocean Days 2025, Epps emphasised the need for sustainable financing to support and scale marine conservation initiatives such as Green Fins.\nActivities earlier in the week with the Coral Triangle Center in Sanur and Ceningan Divers in the Nusa Penida Marine Protected Area shaped the IUCN Ocean Directors message at the conference and showcase, aligning with the theme of the blue economy and impact finance to sustain marine ecosystems.\nTourism has such a big impact on marine biodiversity, and we need it to adhere to a certain code of conduct, Epps said. That is why through our funding facilities, we worked with The Reef-World Foundation advancing Green Fins so dive operators can become certified with standards. But this kind of initiative has been around for a long time and its also a tool used to improve [MPA management], but it needs to come with a business model. I also believe in market-based instruments to evolve this programme.\nIUCNs visit is part of their Blue Natural Capital Financing Facility (BNCFF), which supports at least 21 projects around the world, building the business case for investing in the future of our ocean.\nIn Indonesia, the project supported by IUCN was developed in partnership with The Reef-World Foundation, the Coordinating Body on the Seas of East Asia (COBSEA) and the Coral Triangle Center, which serves as the local implementing organisation for Green Fins. The initiative engages marine tourism businesses through voluntary sustainability certification based on the only internationally recognised environmental standards for diving and snorkelling operations. Green Fins activities aim to reduce negative environmental impacts associated with marine tourism activities as well as improve the management of marine protected areas.\nIUCNs promotion of Green Fins in Bali Ocean Days signals the need for greater private sector engagement in marine conservation across Indonesia and beyond.\nInvestors, donors, marine tourism operators and stakeholders looking to support scalable marine conservation solutions are encouraged to explore opportunities with The Reef-World Foundation, the international coordinator of the Green Fins initiative.

        "article text": "Workers around MWFs can be exposed by breathing aerosols generated during the machining process, or through skin contact when they handle parts, tools, and equipment.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reports that millions of people are exposed to machining fluids on the job. This is due to the fact that metalworking fluids (MWFs) are used in a number of industries to reduce heat and friction, and to remove metal particles in industrial machining and grinding operations.When MWFs are used, a primary concern is the presence of contaminants that encourage the growth of bacteria and fungi. One of the more commonly isolated types of bacteria from MWFs isPseudomonas. Others includeKlebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter,and more. Fungal contamination fromAspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, and other species is also a concern.Regarding these potential exposure risks, OSHA offers the following warning:While MWFs are used by many workers safely, problems can develop when good hygiene practices are not followed or when fluids are not properly managed or maintained. Major health concerns of improperly managed fluids or when good hygiene practices are not followed include skin irritation, allergic contact dermatitis, irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, and, occasionally, breathing difficulties such as bronchitis and asthma. Although rare, some workers have contacted hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) from improperly managed fluids.Contaminants in some types of MWFs may include bacterial and fungal cells, or cell components and their related biological byproducts, such as endotoxins, exotoxins, and mycotoxins, said Harry Pena, President of Zimmetry Environmental. Workers around MWFs can be exposed by breathing aerosols generated during the machining process, or through skin contact when they handle parts, tools, and equipment.Assisting companies that utilize metalworking fluids to protect their workers and comply with health and safety regulations are the industrial hygiene professionals at Zimmetry Environmental. They offer proactive sampling of MWFs to identify contaminants, air sampling around workers to determine if inhalation risks are present, personal protective equipment training, and worksite assessments to evaluate engineering controls and other potential safety resources.

        "article text": "Meet the colourful extravaganza of the RCW 38 stellar nursery, located some 5500 light-years away from us, in the constellationVela. With its bright streaks and swirls, this birthplace of stars is not afraid to flaunt its colours. From the vivid pink of gas clouds to the multi-coloured dots, which are young stars, this image has it all.\nCompared to our Sun, which at about 4.6 billion years old is in a stable phase of its life, the stars in RCW 38 are still very young. At less than a million years old, RCW 38 contains some 2000 stars, creating this psychedelic landscape. This young star cluster is bustling with activity, which makes it an interesting target for astronomers to observe.\nStar clusters are like giant pressure cookers, containing all the ingredients for star formation: dense gas clouds and opaque clumps of cosmic dust. When this mixture of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity, a star is born.\nThe strong radiation coming from these newborn stars makes the gas that encompasses the star cluster glow brightly, creating the pink hues we see here in RCW 38. Its truly a spectacular sight! Yet in visible light many stars in the RCW 38 cluster remain hidden from us, because dust blocks our view of them.\nThat is where theVISTAtelescope, at ESOsParanal Observatory, comes in: itsVIRCAMcamera observes infrared light which, unlike visible light, can go through dust almost unimpeded, revealing the true riches of RCW 38. Suddenly, we also see young stars within dusty cocoons, or cold failed stars known as brown dwarfs.\nThis infrared image was taken during the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) survey, which has produced the most detailedinfrared map of our home galaxyever made. Surveys like this reveal as yet unknown astronomical objects, or give us a new view of known ones.\nSince this image was taken, VISTAs faithful VIRCAM camera, which has conducted numerous imaging surveys since 2008, has retired after an impressive run. Later this year, the telescope will receive a brand new instrument called4MOST, which will gather the spectra of 2400 objects at once over a large area of the sky. As VISTA is born again, the future looks bright.\nThe European Southern Observatory (ESO) enables scientists worldwide to discover the secrets of the Universe for the benefit of all. We design, build and operate world-class observatories on the ground  which astronomers use to tackle exciting questions and spread the fascination of astronomy  and promote international collaboration for astronomy. Established as an intergovernmental organisation in 1962, today ESO is supported by 16 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), along with the host state of Chile and with Australia as a Strategic Partner. ESOs headquarters and its visitor centre and planetarium, the ESO Supernova, are located close to Munich in Germany, while the Chilean Atacama Desert, a marvellous place with unique conditions to observe the sky, hosts our telescopes. ESO operates three observing sites: La Silla, Paranal and Chajnantor. At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope and its Very Large Telescope Interferometer, as well as survey telescopes such as VISTA. Also at Paranal ESO will host and operate the Cherenkov Telescope Array South, the worlds largest and most sensitive gamma-ray observatory. Together with international partners, ESO operates ALMA on Chajnantor, a facility that observes the skies in the millimetre and submillimetre range. At Cerro Armazones, near Paranal, we are building the worlds biggest eye on the sky  ESOs Extremely Large Telescope. From our offices in Santiago, Chile we support our operations in the country and engage with Chilean partners and society.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334314/334314-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334314\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "The Supreme Court of Cassation will hold a hearing to decide if the national courts in Italy can decide on climate-related matters in their jurisdiction. The outcome of this hearing will be decisive for the admissibility of the Giusta Causa (Just Cause), theclimate lawsuit brought by 12 citizens, Greenpeace Italy and ReCommon, and for all climate litigation in Italy. The hearing will be held behind closed doors by the extended panel of the Court (United Sections), attesting to the complexity and the importance of the matter at hand. The verdict will likely be made public at a later date.\nIn May 2023, 12 Italian citizens and the two associations filed a civil lawsuit against ENI, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti S.p.A. (CDP) for their significant contribution to the climate crisis, the latter two entities in their capacity as shareholders exercising a dominant influence over ENI. The plaintiffs argue that the Italian gas and oil giant has knowingly caused damage, and will continue to cause both financial and non-financial damages as a result of its business activities.\nCourts throughout the European Union  from the Netherlands to Belgium, to France and Germany  recognise jurisdiction over climate cases. It would be a serious step backwards if Italy were to isolate itself from this European legal framework, also contravening what was recently established by the European Court of Human Rights. We trust that the United Sections of the Court of Cassation will accept our appeal, recognising that climate change is also a matter for the courts.\nThe climate emergency is worsening and its impacts in Italy are increasingly dramatic, both in terms of victims and economic damage. The fundamental human rights of a growing number of people are either already impacted or at stake. We demand accountability of those responsible for this crisis, first and foremost the large fossil fuel companies who have been aware for decades of the climate and human rights crisis their business activities would cause. This is a matter of climate justice Greenpeace Italy and Recommon state.ENI, CDP and MEF have claimed that national courts in Italy have no authority or jurisdiction to hear the case and rule on climate matters. For this reason, in June 2024, the plaintiffs of the Giusta Causa (The Just Cause) case requested the Supreme Court of Cassation to clarify if courts in Italy have the authority to rule over climate change-related legal claims.  The decision of the Court will have an impact on every current and future climate case in Italy and, therefore, on the protection of people in Italy from the impacts of the climate crisis,  a right already recognised by the European Court of Human Rights in the herstorical Judgement of theVerein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz and Others v.

        "article text": "Over 100 partners, including 37 tech companies, eleven countries and five international organizations, have joined forces under theCoalition for Environmentally Sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI), aiming to ramp up global momentum to place AI on a more environmentally sustainable path. Spearheaded by France, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Coalition brings together stakeholders across the AI value chain for dialogue and ambitious collaborative initiatives.\nThe Coalition was announced at the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit in Paris, where Heads of State and Government, leaders of international organizations, CEOs, academics, artists, and members of civil society gathered to discuss support for AI innovation, adequate regulation, and respect for rights to ensure development of these technologies in the interests of all, including developing countries.\nThe Coalition will encourage AI initiatives for the planet, including its role in decarbonizing economies, reducing pollution, preserving biodiversity, protecting the oceans, and ensuring humanity operates within planetary boundaries. It will use a collaborative approach  bringing together governments, academia, civil society, and the private sector  to focus on standardized methods and metrics for measuring AIs environmental impacts, comprehensive life cycle analysis frameworks for reporting and disclosure, and prioritization of research on sustainable AI.\nWe know that AI can be a force for climate action and energy efficiency. But we also know AI power-intensive systems are already placing an unsustainable strain on our planet, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in hisremarksat the Summit. So it is crucial to design AI algorithms and infrastructures that consume less energy and integrate AI into smart grids to optimize power use.\nWhile AI may help tackle some of the worlds biggest environmental emergencies  for instance, it is being used tomap the destructive dredgingof sand andchart emissionsof methane, a potent greenhouse gas  a growing body of research cautions that there is a negative side to the explosion of AI and its associated infrastructure, including the electronic waste produced  and high levels of electricity and water consumed  by the proliferating data centres that house AI servers produce electronic waste.\nFrom data centres to training models, AI must run on sustainable energy that  fuels a more sustainable future. The Coalition aims to build sustainable AI into the global discussion in much the same way AI security or AI ethics are studied.\nMore than 190 countries have adopted a series of non-binding recommendations on the ethical use of AI, which covers the environment. In addition, both the European Union and the United States of America have introduced legislation to temper the environmental impact of AI. However, the policy landscape remains sparse.\nA number of recent initiatives are working to build the knowledge base around AI and the environment: through the National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (INRIA) and the French Ministry of Ecological Transition, a community of 36 scientists, companies, public institutions and international organizations have publisheda position paperidentifying the challenges that must be overcome to maximize the positive effects of AI systems while limiting their environmental impact. The first hackathon combining AI and energy sobriety, theFrugal AI Challenge, also brought together more than 60 teams of data scientists around the unprecedented challenge of designing AI models related to environmental issues, including the detection of climate disinformation, analysis of regions at risk of fires, identification of illegal deforestation) while optimizing their energy efficiency. In addition, the firstinternational working groupon the use of generative AI to provide access to environmental knowledge aims to develop a best practice guide for the effective and ethical use of generative AI to provide access to environmental documents, while a multi-stakeholderGreen Digital Action initiative, convened by ITU, has launched a new thematic pillar on green computing with a dedicated Sustainable AI working group.\nIn 2024, UNEP released anissue notethat explores AIs environmental footprint and considers how the technology can be rolled out sustainably; it followed a major UNEP report,Navigating New Horizons, which also examined AIs promise and perils. In 2025, UNEP will publish a guide to encourage public and private purchases towards energy-efficient data centres. These guidelines will be based on international best practices and established global standards (EU Code of Conduct, Energy Star, ISO/IEC 30134, etc.). They will inform investors, development banks and local authorities on the objective elements defining an energy-efficient data centre.\nThe power of AI to solve complex global challenges is becoming ever clearer, but so too are its environmental impacts and the need for environmental guardrails to ensure the field grows sustainably, said Golestan (Sally) Radwan, Chief Digital Officer for UNEP. The new Coalition brings together critical stakeholders who have the power to work together and build systems that ensure the net effect of AI on the planet is positive as the technology continues to deploy rapidly.\nNOTES TO EDITORSAbout the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)\nUNEP is the leading global voice on the environment.

        "article text": "The EU locomotive is moving, but whos on board?The new EU Commission has put its machinery on track, guided by the so-calledCompetitiveness Compass. President von der Leyen has insisted that the new trajectory wont derail the Green Deals objectives. But now that the white smoke from the starting engines is clearing, a troubling curve in the track is emerging  one that diverts Europe away from sustainable prosperity and straight into the pockets of corporate laggards.\nALL THE ALARMS RAISED\nBusiness Inside, People Not Invited,read thebannerheld up by NGOs, including the EEB, trade unions and everyone else standing up in front of the EU Commission yesterday. Inside, the Commission held aninvite-onlystakeholder roundtable to discuss the Omnibus Simplification Package, a process that should have included public consultation Instead, the guest list was stacked with big banks, oil giants, and corporate lobbyists, while NGOs and even businesses supportive of the Green Deal were conveniently left out.\nSimplifying democracy too?It appears that the Commission intends to present the Omnibus proposal on 26 February, branding it as an unprecedented simplification effort. The lack of public consultation and transparency undermines the Commissions own Better Regulation Guidelines and flies in the face of the EUs Democratic Principles.Our concerns in full.\nWhats the Omnibus?The Omnibus is the new Commissions proposal to rollback reporting obligations for businesses under corporate accountability laws, the CSRD, CSDDD and the EU Taxonomy. In reality, what it risks is stripping these hard-earned laws of their ability to protect people and the planet from corporate harm.\nIf it is meant to be a gift to businesses, it is no more than acadeau empoissoné, poised to cause confusion, distort competition, and punish first movers.Hundreds of stakeholders, including over200 financial market actorswith over 6.6 trillion in assets under management, are raising the alarm bells and have called on the Commission to preserve the integrity and ambition of the EUs sustainable finance framework.\nWe crashed the party.Once we realised our invite had probably not gotten lost in the post, we put our pride aside and decided to invite ourselves. But inside the outlook was not much brighter for civil society. The EEB requested to speak but was denied, while certain business representatives were given the floor twice in the same timeframe.\nWhile very little detail was sharedon the substance of the Commissions plans in the closed-door roundtable, someleaks suggestthat the Omnibus proposal will be far more than a 25% regulatory trim to streamline reporting requirements. If youre like us, all of this might make you wonder whether simplification is just a smokescreen for deregulation for the sake of deregulation rather than anything actually based on fact, impact assessment or proper consultation. Stay tuned!\nRE-OPENING GREEN LAWS COULD BE HELL!\nAh, damn  here we go again.The EUs new economic vision for this mandate inevitably leaves a sense of déjà vu in the air. Competitiveness. Simplification. Buzzwords masking yet another deregulatory push, this time aimed squarely at Green Deal policies in the name of economic prosperity.\nFrom mythos to logos The Commission argues that cutting 25% of regulation would alleviate Europes economic struggles. YET there is no evidence that environmental regulations hinder productivity. In fact, the European Investment Bank (EIB) reports that the largest barriers to investment are high energy costs, labour shortages, and economic uncertainty  not regulation. Many businesses actually see climate regulation as an opportunity, not a threat.\nRegulatory chaos Regulations arent just red tape. They protect us from toxic chemicals, pollution and corporate abuses. They also provide stability, spurring investment and innovation. Reopening agreed lawsbefore theyve even been implementedcreates uncertainty, penalising businesses that have already invested in the green transition.\nBoosts, not breaks Yes, EU rules are far from perfect, and who doesnt want to simplify things where that makes sense? But setting an arbitrary target of 25% less regulation is reckless. Not only for people and the environment, but also for Europes competitiveness. While China and others continue to move forward, Europe risks losing a competitive advantage in the net-zero race. Instead of gutting rules, Europe should streamline processes, beef up administrative capacity, and fully implement the Green Deal at the national level.\nThe real challenge isnt too much regulation.Its making sure the rules work efficiently. Trade unions, environmental NGOs, and consumer organisations have common ground here. But to streamline processes, all voices must be heard, not just corporate lobbyists\nSTAY ON THE TRANSFORMATIVE COURSE\nGrowing a positive future 2025 has the potential to be a BIG year for EU food and farming as the Commission is set to publish its Vision for agriculture and food, following the groundbreaking consensus reached last year where farmers, agri-food industry, and NGOs (including yours truly) concluded that business as usual is not an option. How to achieve this? We havesome recommendations, and deregulation is *shockingly* not one of them. As part of the Commissions newhigh-level agri-food advisory board, we are working hard to build on this success for the benefit of farmers, nature, and consumers. Watch this space.\nGLOBAL CRACKDOWN ON CIVIL SOCIETY\nSerbian protests continue Since last summer, repression against NGOs, grassroots activists, students, and independent journalists in Serbia has intensified  marked by surveillance, detentions, and unchecked violence from para-state groups. Meanwhile, tens of thousands continue to take to the streets for the third month in a row following the tragic Novi Sad train station collapse, which killed 15 people. Their demand?Transparency and accountability.We stand in full solidarity with those protesting for justice and denounce the arrests of peaceful demonstrators. There is no democracy without the right to protest safely.A reflection from our colleague.\nSouth Korea: Activists detained On 30 November, four Greenpeace activists  Al, Ash, Jens, and Sam  boarded a tanker at Hyundai Daesan Refinery in South Korea to protest the toxic plastic trade. Their message was clear: world leaders at the nearby INC5 negotiations in Busan must take urgent action to end plastic pollution. The activists were detained for nearly two days and remain under investigation, barred from leaving South Korea indefinitely. Captain Hettie of the Rainbow Warrior is also being prevented from departing.Take actionsign the petition here.\nDont walk alone FromBrusselsto Belgrade, a coordinated push to silence civil society is underway. Without watchdogs, democracy crumbles. Without active, organised civil society, democratic institutions slide into kleptocracy. We stand firm in solidarity with all those defending civic space  because when civil society is under attack, so is democracy itself. Having faced attacks and disinformation campaigns towards the EEB over recent weeks, we know how frustrating it is to waste time and precious resources on distractions when theres so much real, urgent work to be done.\nNGO funding fact-check If youve been following our newsletters, youll know about the politically driven campaign targeting public funding for environmental NGOs in recent weeks. On Monday, we held a press conference with journalists from across Europe and civil society colleagues to set the record straight. We did and flipped the narrative, and we highly recommend thisfact-checkby Politico and this piece byThe Guardian.\nFOLLOW US\nDont stay delulu, deal with the polluluStay connected with us onLinkedIn, Bluesky, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.

        "article text": "·The operator has established a secure communication between two of the hospital groups healthcare centers in Madrid, protecting information by encrypting it using a quantum key distribution (QKD) system.·The project has secured information against possible future quantum computing attacks and has safeguarded confidential data such as patients medical records.·Telefónica will present this solution together with Vithas, exposing real cases, in a session to be held at its MWC booth entitled Quantum-Safe Technologies for Communications.\nTelefónica, in collaboration with Vithas and technology providers such as LuxQuanta and QoolNet, has managed to communicate two hospitals within the Community of Madrid by protecting them through a quantum fiber optic link. With this project, the operator demonstrates the viability of Quantum-Safe securitization of communications between healthcare centers, so that in the future it will be possible to guarantee the immunity of sensitive data such as healthcare data against possible attacks from quantum computers.\nQuantum computing will revolutionize various sectors, allowing great advances in fields such as medicine or scientific research, but it will also open up the possibility of malicious actors to breach the cryptographic techniques that are currently used in most Internet communications. In fact, these actors are already employing a practice known as Store Now, Decrypt Later (SNDL).\nTelefónica, committed to the security of its customers and ahead of emerging technological challenges, has spent more than ten years of research on Quantum-Safe solutions over the most stable and advanced quantum network infrastructures in Europe, to generate confidence in an interconnected and protected future.\nThis company and Vithas, equally committed to the security and confidentiality of healthcare information, in collaboration with the Spanish start-up LuxQuanta, which specializes in QKD technology, and QoolNet, a spin-off of the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM), have implemented, through dedicated fiber links connecting the two hospitals, a quantum key distribution (QKD) system, which, unlike other alternatives based on complex mathematical algorithms (therefore susceptible to attack), is based on inviolable principles of quantum physics.\nFor the project, Telefónica relied on two of its exchangesin Madrid to deploy the quantum link that connects the Vithas Madrid Arturo Soria University Hospital with the Vithas Madrid La Milagrosa University Hospital. Both in these exchanges and in the two hospitals, LuxQuanta NOVA LQ® QKD equipment was installed, capable of producing continuous variable quantum signals through the fiber of this operator, and Quantum-Safe solution equipment developed by QoolNet-UPM, in charge of coordinating the different fiber sections to ensure the sending of quantum keys from one end to the other. These keys were finally delivered to Fortinets next-generation firewalls to encrypt end-to-end communications between the two hospitals. Once this secure channel was established, it was used for hospital use cases such as sending medical information, teleconsultation or telemonitoring of patients, thanks to the collaboration of Prhoinsa, Proyectos Hospitalarios Internacional, which also supplied equipment from the manufacturer BLT Biolight and an operating room computer from the manufacturer ACL.\nSensitive information such as medical records, which must always remain confidential, serves as an example of the security needs that this type of healthcare communications will require, and to which the protection that Telefónica has already tested in the two Vithas hospitals mentioned above provides an answer.\nThe development of quantum computing, in addition to accelerating advances in various sectors, is a challenge for the protection of communications, given the computing power that this computation can reach and that can be used maliciously to break encryption algorithms currently in use. In the healthcare sector, personal patient data, from a clinical report to an X-ray, as well as remote monitoring, are examples of the security needs that communications such as healthcare will require and to which the quantum distribution of keys, already successfully tested by Telefónica, gives a solution.\nSecure patient information\nLeonor Ostos, Innovation Manager at Telefónica España, emphasizes: Together with Vithas and the other partners, we have successfully tested quantum key distribution in such a critical environment as healthcare, relying on our fiber network to establish a secure communications channel for sensitive data and anticipating with new technological solutions to future threats that the technology itself may generate.\nÁngel Ayuso, managing director of Fundación Vithas and corporate scientific director, says: At Vithas Hospitals we are very aware of the sensitivity of the patients information we handle, and we make every effort to ensure its confidentiality. Participating in this project in collaboration with Telefónica, LuxQuanta, QoolNet-UPM, Fortinet and Prhoinsa, for the testing of quantum key distribution technologies, has undoubtedly been a step in the right direction to ensure that patient information remains secure and unaltered, today and in the future.\nWithin the Mobile World Congress (MWC) that will be held in Barcelona from March 3 to 6, Telefónica will present several new developments in quantum technologies. The operator will bring its own demo with various use cases and has also scheduled several talks in the Ágora of its stand, including a session entitled Quantum-Safe Technologies for Communications, which will take place on March 4 at 12:15 p.m., and which will provide more detailed information on this project, with representatives from Telefónica and Vithas.\nFor more information:Telefónica at the MWC 2025\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334301/334301-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334301\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

His comprehensive understanding of both civil and criminal law, coupled with his hands-on experience, provides him with a unique vantage point to critique current policies and propose actionable solutions.OK, No Immigration Reform(But Lets Use The Laws Already On The Books) digs into the multiplicity of existing immigration laws that, if properly executed, may address many of the systems current problems. Jennings contends that the US governments inability to enforce these laws has created the image of a broken system, while, in fact, the groundwork for effective immigration control already exists.Jennings highlights the gaps and inefficiencies in the current enforcement of immigration laws, providing real-world examples from his extensive legal career. Rather than advocating for sweeping reforms, Jennings suggests practical solutions grounded in the existing legal framework.

        "article text": "Carlos R. Hamilton Jr.s great book,Reflections on Faith and 17th Century European-American Colonists: As Seen Through the Lives of Four Young Immigrantsprovides a new and scholarly perspective on the experiences of early European immigrants to America, showing the significant effect that their journeys had on the formation of the United States.In this meticulously researched work, Carlos tells the stories of four young immigrants who left Europe during the Age of Enlightenment to seek new opportunities in the uncertain, untamed land of colonial America. These individuals were part of a larger wave of settlers who sought religious freedom, economic opportunities, and security for themselves and their families, motivations that still resonate with many immigrants today.One of the important aspects ofReflections on Faithis religions influence in the lives of the early colonists. For many, the opportunity to openly practice their faith was a key motivator for taking the perilous trek over the Atlantic. The book digs into the personal and collective hardships these immigrants experienced in a new nation distant from their European background, as well as how their religious beliefs shaped not only their own lives but also the social and governmental systems that would eventually become the United States.While the book focuses on Anglo-European immigration in the 17th century, Hamilton makes a persuasive case that the incentives driving immigration at the time are strikingly similar to those motivating modern immigration. Many immigrants crossings to America continue to be driven by a desire for religious freedom, economic opportunity, and personal security.Carlos also recognizes the larger backdrop of American immigration history, recognizing the important contributions played by immigrants from African, Latino, and Asian backgrounds in forming the countrys culture and society. Though the book focuses on European colonists, Hamilton highlights the necessity of understanding the different experiences that helped shape Americas cultural mosaic.Reflections on Faithis not only an intimate travel story, but also an academic investigation of how the experiences of these early immigrants shaped the United States growing identity. Carlos investigates the social, political, and religious influences that shaped American governance, culture, and ideals through the lives of four young colonists.Carlos work is an important contribution to the study of American colonial history, providing insights into the early immigrant experience with far-reaching consequences for learning the countrys past and future. As immigration disputes continue,Reflections on Faithprovides a historical perspective that sheds insight on why individuals have always been drawn to America and what they have contributed to the countrys enduring identity.Reflections on Faith and 17th Century European-American Colonists: As Seen Through the Lives of Four Young Immigrantsis available atwww.amazon.com, Get your copy now!About the AuthorCarlos R.

        "article text": "Compiled from letters found after their parents deaths,Memoirs of a Wartime Romanceis a mesmerizing story of love, resilience, and bravery. This fascinating story tells the true story of Gretchen Boody and Edward Siegel, whose passion grew during the upheaval of World War II, demonstrating their unwavering loyalty to each other in the face of overwhelming difficulties.Memoirs of a Wartime Romancetake readers back to January 8, 1942, when Gretchen Boody, an Army nurse from Wisconsin, and Edward Siegel, an Army doctor from New York, met on a troop ship bound for Panama. Their adventure together during their deployment quickly transitions from professional camaraderie to profound and deep love.

        "article text": "Mango, one of the leading international fashion brands, is gaining capillarity in Spain and consolidating its presence in Barcelona with a new flagship store. Today, the company is opening a store at number 514 Avenida Diagonal, in the emblematic Correa & Milá building inaugurated in 1989.\nThe new store, which has a selling space of over 1,500 m² distributed on three floors, sells Woman, Man, Kids and Teen products, being the first in the Catalan capital and the third in Spain to have the four lines under the same roof, after the stores in Calle Serrano and Plaza España, in Madrid.\nThe store also features the Mediterranean-inspired retail concept, New Med, which embodies the spirit and freshness of the brand. Sustainability and architectural integration are key in this new design, which conceives the Mango store as a Mediterranean home with different rooms in which warm tones and neutral colours predominate, combined with traditional, artisanal, sustainable and natural materials.\nAs a novel feature, the store pays homage to the influential legacy of the Barcelona duo Correa & Milá, creators of the emblematic façade of the building, inaugurated in 1989, as a space that reinterprets their most iconic architectural gestures through two key elements: the circle and colour. The entrance has been designed with circular geometrical forms on the ceiling and podiums, taking the circular gesture of the exterior awning to the store interior. On the staircase, burgundy invades the different levels of the store.\nThis store opening is part of the companys 4E 2024-2026 Strategic Plan, which aims to strengthen its differentiated value proposition, with a strong drive towards expansion and improving sales in the existing store network and on its online channel.\nMango in Barcelona\nMango opened its first store in Barcelona in 1984. The company currently has 23 stores in Catalan capital with a combined selling space of close to 15,000 m².\nIn recent months, Mango has strengthened its presence in Barcelona with the opening of a store for its Mango Teen youth line at number 65 Paseo de Gracia in Barcelona, the same premises where Isak Andic opened the first Mango store in 1984.\nRecently, the company has also made progress in its store refurbishment plan, with the reopening of the stores at number 90 Rambla Catalunya, in the former Cine Alexandra building, and the Westfield Glòries, La Maquinista and Maremagnum shopping centres, in addition to the Mango Kids store located at number 22 Paseo de Gracia, the childrens line store with the highest turnover in the world, with its new Kids Lab image.\nMango closed 2024 with more than 400 stores in the Spain, in addition to an online presence through its own e-commerce and third-party platforms. In global terms, the company has more than 2,800 stores in over 120 markets on all five continents.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/334228/334228-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334228\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "In Aug. 2024, a team of NASA researchers and partners gathered in Missoula, to test new drone-based technology for localized forecasting, or micrometeorology. Researchers attached wind sensors to a drone, NASAs Alta X quadcopter, aiming to provide precise and sustainable meteorological data to help predict fire behavior.\nWildfires areincreasing in number and severityaround the world, including the United States, and wind is a major factor. It leads to unexpected and unpredictable fire growth, public threats, and fire fatalities, making micrometeorology a very effective tool to combat fire.\nThe campaign was run by NASAsFireSenseproject, focused on addressing challenges in wildland fire management by putting NASA science and technology in the hands of operational agencies.\nEnsuring that the new technology will be easily adoptable by operational agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and the National Weather Service was another primary goal of the campaign, said Jacquelyn Shuman, FireSense project scientist at NASAs Ames Research Center in Californias Silicon Valley.\nThe FireSense team chose the Alta X drone because the U.S. Forest Service already has a fleet of the quadcopters and trained drone pilots, which could make integrating the needed sensors  and the accompanying infrastructure  much easier and more cost-effective for the agency.\nThe choice of the two sensors for the drones payload was also driven by their adoptability.\nThe first, called a radiosonde, measures wind direction and speed, humidity, temperature, and pressure, and is used daily by the National Weather Service. The other sensor, an anemometer, measures wind speed and direction, and is used at weather stations and airports around the world.\nAnemometers are everywhere, but are usually stationary, said Robert McSwain, the FireSense uncrewed aerial system (UAS) lead, based at NASAs Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. We are taking a sensor type that is already used all over the world, and giving it wings.\nBoth sensors create datasets that are already familiar to meteorologists worldwide, which opens up the potential applications of the platform.\nTraditionally, global weather forecasting data is gathered by attaching a radiosonde to a weather balloon and releasing it into the air. This system works well for regional weather forecasts. But the rapidly changing environment of wildland fire requires more recurrent, pinpointed forecasts to accurately predict fire behavior. Its the perfect niche for a drone.\nThese drones are not meant to replace the weather balloons, said Jennifer Fowler, FireSenses project manager at Langley. The goal is to create a drop-in solution to get more frequent, localized data for wildfires  not to replace all weather forecasting.\nDrones can be piloted to keep making measurements over a precise location  an on-site forecaster could fly one every couple of hours as conditions change  and gather timely data to help determine how weather will impact the direction and speed of a fire.\nFire crews on the ground may need this information to make quick decisions about where to deploy firefighters and resources, draw fire lines, and protect nearby communities.\nA reusable platform, like a drone, also reduces the financial and environmental impact of forecasting flights.\nA weather balloon is going to be a one-off, and the attached sensor wont be recovered, Fowler said. The instrumented drone, on the other hand, can be flown repeatedly.\nBefore such technology can be sent out to a fire, it needs to be tested. Thats what the FireSense team did this summer.\nMcSwain described the conditions in Missoula as an alignment of stars for the research: the complex mountain terrain produces erratic, historically unpredictable winds, and the sparsity of monitoring instruments on the ground makes weather forecasting very difficult. During the three-day campaign, several fires burned nearby, which allowed researchers to test how the drones performed in smokey conditions.\nA drone team out of NASA Langley conducted eight data-collection flights in Missoula. Before each drone flight, student teams from the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho, and Salish Kootenai College in Pablo, Montana, launched a weather balloon carrying the same type ofradiometer.Oncethose data sets were created, they needed to be transformed into a usable format. Meteorologists are used to the numbers, but incident commanders on an active fire need to see the data in a form that allows them to quickly understand which conditions are changing, and how. Thats where data visualization partners come in. For the Missoula campaign, teams from MITRE, NVIDIA, and Esri joined NASA in the field.\nMeasurements from both the balloon and the drone platforms were immediately sent to the on-site data teams. The MITRE team, together with NVIDIA, tested high-resolution artificial intelligence meteorological models, while the Esri team created comprehensive visualizations of flight paths, temperatures, and wind speed and direction. These visual representations of the data make conclusions more immediately apparent to non-meteorologists.\nDevelopment of drone capabilities for fire monitoring didnt begin in Missoula, and it wont end there.\nThis campaign leveraged almost a decade of research, development, engineering, and testing, said McSwain. We have built up a UAS flight capability that can now be used across NASA.\nThe NASA Alta X and its sensor payload will head to Alabama and Florida in spring 2025, incorporating improvements identified in Montana. There, the team will perform another technology demonstration with wildland fire managers from a different region.\nTo view more photos from the FireSense campaign visit:https://nasa.gov/firesense\nThe FireSense project is led by NASA Headquarters in Washington and sits within the Wildland Fires program, with the project office based at NASA Ames. The goal of FireSense is to transition Earth science and technological capabilities to operational wildland fire management agencies, to address challenges in U.S. wildland fire management before, during, and after a fire.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/334227/334227-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334227\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

These leaders have earned recognition for their ability to successfully navigate a swiftly evolving global market while upholding ethical business practices, thereby reinforcing South Koreas prominent role in global corporate leadership.\nAt the forefront of South Koreas line-up of brand guardians isKang Shin-ho, CEO ofCJ CheilJedang, who ranked 38th globally with a BGI score of 79 out of 100. His exceptional performance in both the business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) sectors, particularly in areas such as strategy and vision, long-term value focus, and positive change, has been instrumental to CJ CheilJedangs success. In just one year in the role, Kang Shin-ho has not only broken into the top 50 but also emerged as the leading brand guardian in the global food sector for the first time, a testament to his ability to drive meaningful change and foster long-term success.\nSamsung GroupCEOHan Jong-Heeranks 51st globally this year, with a BGI score of 77.7 out of 100. While his ranking slipped from 37th last year, his leadership has driven an impressive 11% increase in Samsungs brand value, reaching USD110.6 billion. This growth is largely attributed to key factors such as artificial intelligence, strategic vision, commercially shrewd, and a keen focus on customer needs in the B2C sector. Despite the drop in the individual ranking, his leadership has been pivotal in cementing Samsungs position as South Koreas most valuable and strongest brand in the 2025 Global 500 rankings, reinforcing its enduring global influence and market leadership.\nJae-Hoon Chang, CEO ofHyundai Group, achieved 71st place in the BGI ranking with a score of 76 out of 100. This score was derived from key attributes such as artificial intelligence, strategic vision, customer needs, and sustainability within the B2C sector. Changs strategic emphasis on innovation and sustainability has been pivotal in Hyundais continued growth and its strong performance in the global market.\nAlex Haigh, Managing Director Asia Pacific, Brand Finance,commented:\n[i\"Kang Shin-ho, Han Jong-Hee, and Jae-Hoon Chang have demonstrated exceptional leadership, propelling their companies to new heights. Their impressive rankings in the Brand Guardianship Index 2025 highlight their strategic vision and unwavering commitment to innovation and growth. These leaders exemplify South Koreas strength in global business, setting the standard for excellence in todays competitive market. Their continued success is a testament to their ability to drive sustainable growth and lead with purpose in an ever-evolving landscape\"[/i]\nTheBGI 2025reveals that perceptions of sustainability remain integral to CEO reputation. There is a strong correlation between a companys sustainability efforts and the public perception of its CEO, with nearly half of the variation in CEO reputation attributed to how committed to sustainability the CEO is perceived to be.\nHowever, this years findings highlight a shift in priorities. The most critical driver of CEO reputation is now cares about employees, reflecting heightened expectations for empathy in leadership amid economic uncertainty, mental health challenges, and rapid technological changes. Other key drivers include positive change, trustworthy, customer needs, and sustainability.\nBrand Financeis the worlds leading brand valuation consultancy. Bridging the gap between marketing and finance, Brand Finance evaluates the strength of brands and quantifies their financial value to help organisations make strategic decisions.\nHeadquartered in London, Brand Finance operates in over 25 countries. Every year, Brand Finance conducts more than 6,000 brand valuations, supported by original market research, and publishes over 100 reports which rank brands across all sectors and countries.\nBrand Finance also operates the Global Brand Equity Monitor, conducting original market research annually on 6,000 brands, surveying more than 175,000 respondents across 41 countries and 31 industry sectors. By combining perceptual data from the Global Brand Equity Monitor with data from its valuation database  the largest brand value database in the world  Brand Finance equips ambitious brand leaders with the data, analytics, and the strategic guidance they need to enhance brand and business value.\nIn addition to calculating brand value, Brand Finance also determines the relative strength of brands through a balanced scorecard of metrics evaluating marketing investment, stakeholder equity, and business performance, compliant with ISO 20671.\nBrand Finance is a regulated accountancy firm and a committed leader in the standardisation of the brand valuation industry. Brand Finance was the first to be certified by independent auditors as compliant with both ISO 10668 and ISO 20671 and has received the official endorsement of the Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) in the United States.\nBrand is defined as a marketing-related intangible asset including, but not limited to, names, terms, signs, symbols, logos, and designs, intended to identify goods, services, or entities, creating distinctive images and associations in the minds of stakeholders, thereby generating economic benefits.\nBrand strength is the efficacy of a brands performance on intangible measures relative to its competitors. Brand Finance evaluates brand strength in a process compliant with ISO 20671, looking at Marketing Investment, Stakeholder Equity, and the impact of those on Business Performance. The data used is derived from Brand Finances proprietary market research programme and from publicly available sources.\nEach brand is assigned a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score out of 100, which feeds into the brand value calculation. Based on the score, each brand is assigned a corresponding Brand Rating up to AAA+ in a format similar to a credit rating.\nBrand Finance calculates the values of brands in its rankings using the Royalty Relief approach  a brand valuation method compliant with the industry standards set in ISO 10668. It involves estimating the likely future revenues that are attributable to a brand by calculating a royalty rate that would be charged for its use, to arrive at a brand value understood as a net economic benefit that a brand owner would achieve by licensing the brand in the open market.\nThe steps in this process are as follows:\n1 Calculate brand strength using a balanced scorecard of metrics assessing Marketing Investment, Stakeholder Equity, and Business Performance. Brand strength is expressed as a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score on a scale of 0 to 100.\n2 Determine royalty range for each industry, reflecting the importance of brand to purchasing decisions. In luxury, the maximum percentage is high, while in extractive industry, where goods are often commoditised, it is lower. This is done by reviewing comparable licensing agreements sourced from Brand Finances extensive database.\n3 Calculate royalty rate. The BSI score is applied to the royalty range to arrive at a royalty rate. For example, if the royalty range in a sector is 0-5% and a brand has a BSI score of 80 out of 100, then an appropriate royalty rate for the use of this brand in the given sector will be 4%.\n4 Determine brand-specific revenues by estimating a proportion of parent company revenues attributable to a brand.\n5 Determine forecast revenues using a function of historic revenues, equity analyst forecasts, and economic growth rates.\n6 Apply the royalty rate to the forecast revenues to derive brand revenues.\n7 Discount post-tax brand revenues to a net present value which equals the brand value.\nBrand Finance has produced this study with an independent and unbiased analysis. The values derived and opinions presented in this study are based on publicly available information and certain assumptions that Brand Finance used where such data was deficient or unclear.

        "article text": "The latest version of the BMW X3 is poised for market launch in China. The countrys most successful Sports Activity Vehicle will arrive at Chinese dealerships in just a few days and will go on sale later in February 2025.\nDrive system: two petrol engines to choose from.\nThis exclusive version of the BMW X3 was developed and will be produced specifically for the Chinese market to meet the exacting expectations of customers in the high-growth SAV segment. The outgoing model was the strongest-selling BMW vehicle worldwide in 2023. 156,000 units were delivered in China alone  accounting for around 40 per cent of all BMW X model sales in the region.\nThe new BMW X3 will be launched in China with two engine variants. Customers can choose from a pair of four-cylinder petrol engines: the BMW X3 xDrive 25L Luxury develops 140 kW (190 hp) and maximum torque of 310 Nm (229 lb-ft). This is enough to accelerate from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 8.7 seconds on the way to a top speed of 214 km/h (133 mph). The even more dynamic BMW X3 xDrive 30L  available in the equipment variants Pioneering MSP and Exclusive MSP  generates 190 kW (258 hp) and peak torque of 400 Nm (295 lb-ft), and sprints from rest to 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 6.5 seconds. Top speed is 239 km/h (148 mph).\nLonger wheelbase, more space, more comfort.Alongside its BMW-typical sporting ability, the new SAV for the premium midsize class majors on high quality and comfort. For the first time, the version of the BMW X3 produced in China for China has an extended wheelbase. Yet it also retains the 50:50 weight distribution for which BMW is renowned, which results in almost perfect balance and therefore top-class handling. In addition, the 111-millimetre-longer wheelbase ensures even smoother and even more stable driving characteristics. And once inside, passengers can enjoy a significantly enhanced feeling of space.\nThis extra spaciousness is particularly noticeable in the rear compartment. Here, kneeroom has increased by a full 96 millimetres and legroom to over a metre. The new BMW X3 with extended wheelbase is 126 millimetres longer than the predecessor model and 25 millimetres wider. Its exterior length of 4,865 millimetres and width of 1,920 millimetres also mean it has the largest dimensions of any vehicle in its segment. However, it still has the hallmark proportions of a BMW X model, complete with a long roofline flowing smoothly into the rear end and a dynamically stretched silhouette.\nGenerous and exclusive equipment with a host of highlights.The luxurious driving experience is complemented by the high-quality and exclusive specification of the new BMW X3. Playing a prominent role here are the standard features enhanced by an array of market-specific details. Thanks to the new BMW iDrive based on BMW Operating System 9, customers in China benefit from a large number of exclusive digital services. The content of the BMW Digital Premium offering has been adapted precisely to the particular requirements and demands of customers in the Chinese market.\nThe exterior also stars with exclusive details for the Chinese market. Both model variants come as standard with BMW Iconic Glow contour lighting, which shows off the BMW kidney grille to eye-catching effect. The range of colour shades available comprises five exquisite metallic paint finishes, including a particularly striking Frozen variant that gives the car a visually impactful presence.\nFrom China, for China: local production brings many benefits.The two BMW X3 variants are tailored more keenly than ever to the preferences of discerning target groups in China. The vehicle concept, design, technology and equipment have all been adapted as required with no change to the prices asked for the predecessor model. BMW has also focused on its Shenyang base in China when it comes to development and production. The new BMW X3 models will be built at Plant Lydia, which BMW operates in tandem with its joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) and which employs cutting-edge, resource-conserving and efficient production methods. Local production also reduces transportation distances, optimises logistics and actively contributes to greater sustainability.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/334221/334221-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334221\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Our Summer 2025 campaign is a joyous celebration of our original purpose  to create clothing that protects people from the weather.\nA Burberry love story comes to life through the cinematic lens of this campaign. Its about humour, optimism and, of course, the unpredictability of our great British weather.\nDaniel Lee\nChief Creative Officer\nWith endearingly familiar plot lines and playful dialogue, an A-list cast stars in this urban fairytale of love, life and the rain. Academy Award-winning actor Kate Winslet features alongside Aimee Lou Wood, Chen Kun, Jodie Turner-Smith, Micheal Ward, Nicholas Hoult, Richard E. Grant, Son Sukku and models David Gandy, Liu Wen and Naomi Campbell  with a special guest appearance (and strictly non-speaking role) by a chivalrous Burberry Knight in shining armour.\nCelebrating the long-standing history of the trench coat and the reinvention of this iconic style for summer, the films meld romantic tropes with the ever-inclement British weather. They offer a rain-soaked segue into the brands innovative approach to all-weather expertise, in which heritage and seasonal trench coats feature alongside expressive new silhouettes from Summer 2025.\nAlongside the cinematic campaign, Burberry is launching an all-encompassing celebration including window displays and in-store activations.\nOur Summer 2025 campaign is a joyous celebration of our original purpose  to create clothing that protects people from the weather. It showcases the innovation and craftsmanship that defines Burberry as the ultimate trench and rainwear destination.\nJosh Schulman\nChief Executive Officer\nWindow & store activations\nInspired by the Burberry Summer 2025 collection, window displays are curated to reflect the joyful essence of summertime in London. Delicate clusters of wisteria and pastel blossoms adorn the stores, mirroring the way they bloom on mews and cascade over archways throughout the city. Floral displays are complemented by lime-washed cladding across the space, drawing from Londons historic architecture while reflecting the shades and textures seen across the collection.\nKey Styles\nThe Burberry trench is the ultimate all-weather companion. Created by Thomas Burberry in 1879, gabardine was heralded as the original performance fabric. Its shower-resistant, lightweight and breathable properties offer versatility throughout the seasons and are the reason it remains a cornerstone of Burberry rainwear, as well as British wardrobes.\nHonouring this enduring tradition of protection from unpredictable weather, the Heritage Collection of trench and car coats are crafted from gabardine woven at the Burberry Mill in Keighley, Yorkshire and lined in iconic Burberry Check cotton. Evolutions of these signature styles include the Castleford trench coat, its lighter gabardine weave and partial lining perfectly suited to summer.\nIcons of the house inspire new silhouettes, with trench elements reworked as streamlined jackets in bonded cotton, floaty silk dresses and shirts trimmed with Burberry Check straps. There is a sense of lightness across the collection with archetypal styles cropped, draped and detailed with cutouts and zips for adaptability. Lightweight jackets lean on Burberrys heritage of fabric innovation, updating Prince of Wales check in tri-layer wool and weaving viscose silk with the Burberry Check.\nCreative Direction by Daniel Lee, Artistic Direction by Lane & Associates, Director by David Lane, Director of Photography by Benoît Delhomme, Photography by Drew Vickers, Music by Prefab Sprout\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334212/334212-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334212\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Protecting the vast ocean highways travelled by whales is a critical challenge. As these magnificent creatures undertake their fascinating, often epic, journeys, - innovative work is underway to understand their movements and ensure their survival.From marathon treks by gray whales across thousands of kilometres to shorter seasonal excursions by minkes, migration routes  connecting vital feeding and breeding grounds  are crucial lifelines for whale species.But the story of these awe-inspiring journeys is similar to so much else happening to the natural world right now.Human activities are causing a range of harmful impacts, with fishing gear entanglement, ship strikes, pollution, habitat loss and climate change all turning migration routes into hazardous and sometimes fatal obstacle courses.Protecting these blue corridors must therefore become a priority for everyone who cares about whales.Thats why WWF is working alongside our partners to raise awareness about their importance, including ourgroundbreaking joint reporton whale migrations and the threats they face, and to support solutions such as reducing fishing bycatch, redirecting ship traffic and creating marine protected areas  all backed by scientific research using cutting-edge technology to track whale migrations and reveal the many things, like food sources and climate change, that shape the paths they take.\nFrom the Bering Straits to the waters off the Antarctic Peninsula, the worlds oceans support a diversity of whale populations and migration routes.Whales travel these superhighways along the coast and across open oceans, moving in and out of international and national waters, some covering thousands of kilometres each year.Its widely accepted that migrating whales follow cues that may be biological, cultural (learnt behaviour from other whales) or linked to conditions at specific times or places.Where people see vast, formless seascapes, whales chart a world alive with invisible cues: a whisper of colder water rising from the deep, a hidden ridge beneath the waves, the chemical trace of plankton blooming in the distance, or even the Earths magnetic and gravitational fields.In the past, scientists studied whales as they appeared in different parts of the ocean, but their journey in between remained a mystery.\nToday, satellite technology is helping them to understand more and more about the fascinating journeys whales take.Tags, which are equipped with transmitters that last several months, send a signal every time a tagged animal surfaces, enabling scientists to chart whale movements in granular detail.Satellite data is now helping scientists to understand how changing ocean conditions affect migration patterns for many whale species.For example, 20 years of data from humpbacks tagged in Brazil reveal a gradual southward shift in feeding grounds, coinciding with ice retreat and krill movement.And its not just their movements that are affected.Less food in their traditional feeding grounds may mean mothers lack the energy to sustain pregnancies.Southern right whales typically calve every three years, but recent data shows this has shifted to every four to five years.As with so many other species, adapting to change can be challenging for whales. Some rely on areas that are stable over decades or even centuries.But as ecosystems become more variable, their strategies may need to adapt faster than their cultural or biological cues allow.For example, whales might return to areas where food was once reliable, only to find it gone  a phenomenon called an ecological trap.\nAs whale behaviours and migrations scramble to respond to increasing environmental instability, entire ecosystems feel the ripple effects.\"If migration patterns change significantly over the long-term, it will have cascading impacts on marine ecosystems, says Dr Alex Zerbini, senior research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean and Ecosystem Studies of the University of Washington in the US.For example, whale feeding habits  a humpback can eat more than a ton of krill a day  can shape entire ecosystems, while the way they move carbon and other nutrients around the oceans also has big impacts on the health of the marine environment.\nProtecting whales throughout their long migrations is hugely challenging.Their travels take them  through up to 12 different territorial waters, each with its own laws, and they spend significant time in international waters too.However, the increasing amount of data available about migration routes offers new ways forward − enabling the creation of maps that can help plan marine protected areas or manage ship traffic to avoid harming whales.In the US, for example, theWhale Safe toolis now being used to predict where whales are in the San Francisco Bay and Santa Barbara Channel by combining tracking data with hydrophones.Ship speeds and lanes are adjusted to reduce the risk of fatal collisions  a huge threat around busy ports.Initiatives like this bring genuine hope for a future where whales can once again journey in safety, and keep positively contributing to the health of the worlds oceans.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334208/334208-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334208\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Deutsche Telekom is expanding its Precise Positioning service for business customers to Eastern Europe in cooperation with Swift Navigation. Precise Positioning is based on Swift Navigations Skylark correction service and improves the accuracy of navigation systems by up to 100 times. This is essential for applications such as autonomous driving of cars and tractors. But the robot mower in the home garden can also find its way safely, even without a boundary wire.\nPositioning via satellites is now widespread worldwide, with more than 6 billion devices using systems such as the AmericanGPSand the European Galileo system for positioning and route planning every day. To compensate for inaccuracies in the positioning of satellite navigation systems such as Galileo or GPS, Deutsche Telekom operates a network of antenna sites in Germany and large parts of Europe. With the help of the data measured at these locations, the position can be corrected to an accuracy of a few centimeters. This makes it possible, for example, to use robotic lawnmowers without a boundary wire.\nIn recent years, such sites have been set up in large parts of northern, central, southern and western Europe. This network has now been extended to other countries in eastern Europe. At the same time, the accuracy of the service has been significantly increased to a maximum deviation of 2 cm in open skies. The countries include Croatia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Slovakia. The most south-easterly station is now located on Rhodes, the most westerly on the Azores and the most northerly near Hammerfest in the north of Norway.\nTodays satellite-based navigation systems such as GPS generally achieve an accuracy of several meters. This means that satellite-based positioning is too imprecise for cars, machines, robots or parcel drones to navigate autonomously and safely.\nInaccuracies are caused by turbulence in the atmosphere, deviations in the orbit of the satellites or reflections of the GNSS signal from buildings and window surfaces. The Skylark positioning solution from Swift provides correction information on a second-by-second basis, allowing a navigation system in a vehicle or a robotic lawnmower to compensate for these positioning errors. To do this, an evenly distributed network of special antennas collects data from the most important global navigation satellites and compares it with the precisely measured antenna location. High-precision correction data is calculated on the basis of the information collected in this way and sent in real time via mobile communications to cars, for example. In Europe, Deutsche Telekom andDeutsche Funkturmoperate a network of these special antennas, known as reference stations - with uniform and fail-safe coverage.\nAmong other things, this is needed for\nAbout Swift Navigation:Swift Navigation is a San Francisco-based technology company unlocking vehicle autonomy, robotics, precision logistics, and V2X communication with centimeter accurate positioningglobally and at scale.

        "article text": "RBC has made the mortgage renewal process easier and faster for clients through a new streamlined, self-serve option in the RBC Mobile app1. Now eligible clients can seamlessly and securely renew their RBC mortgage from wherever is most convenient for them. The news comes as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) estimates the total amount of mortgage loans to be renewed over the course of 2024 and 2025 represents close to 40% of the Canadian economy2- a significant number of homeowners.\nClients who choose to renew through the RBC Mobile app will be able to secure their best RBC rate, choose among available mortgage terms that suit their situation, and virtually sign documents  all in a matter of minutes. Clients can also pause the process at any time to speak with an RBC Advisor if they require additional information before completing their renewal.\nWe understand that renewing or applying for a mortgage can feel stressful for clients  which is something were actively addressing, said Janet Boyle, senior vice president, Home Equity Finance, RBC. Today marks the latest stage in our evolution to provide digital and mobile services that enhance security and transparency in the mortgage journey, while offering clients more choice in how they want to manage their mortgage.\nIn the past, most renewals were processed by an RBC Advisor. This new option further simplifies the renewal process while still allowing clients to benefit from additional advice and guidance from RBC Advisors when they need it.\nMobile banking has become a daily digital habit for Canadians. On average, RBCs banking clients use the RBC Mobile app which ranked No. 1 in customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power 2024 Canada Banking Mobile App Satisfaction Study on an almost-daily basis. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, RBC has seen active mobile users increase by 69% and mobile sessions increase by 139%3.\nOur clients are increasingly seeking ways to engage with RBC digitally, said Rami Thabet, senior vice president, Digital, RBC. The rapid increase in adoption and engagement in the RBC Mobile app demonstrates its vital role in providing clients with choice, convenience and secure banking solutions -which is why were thrilled to simplify mortgage renewals for clients in our mobile app.\n-----\n1RBC Online Banking is provided by Royal Bank of Canada.

        "article text": "This impact story is part of a series featuring companies that are members ofOne Planet Business for Biodiversity (OP2B)/ World Business Council of Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Through these stories, we aim to showcase our members commitment to driving the transition to regenerative agricultural practices, the impact on farmers and the role OP2B plays in supporting this transformation.\nPernod Ricard, the worlds second-largest wine and spirits company, is addressing global environmental challenges with innovative regenerative agriculture initiatives. Pernod Ricard sources their ingredients, wheat, barley, cane, beet, grapes, agave and many different flavouring ingredients, from over 380,000 hectares of land across the globe. In a joint interview, Morgane Yvergniaux, Director of Nature & Climate, and Gaël Dupont, a pioneering Champagne winemaker, share how the companys global strategy drives local impact.\nFounded by Paul Ricard, who held a profound appreciation for nature, Pernod Ricard  has long recognized its dependency on healthy terroirs. In 2019, it formalized this commitment by embedding Nurturing Terroirs as one of the four pillars of its corporate responsibility strategy Good Times from a Good Place.\nOur strategy is not merely a response to environmental challenges but a deliberate step to ensure the resilience of the ecosystems that underpin our business, explains Morgane Yvergniaux,  Director of Nature & Climate at Pernod Ricard. By addressing the fragilities of our terroirs through science-based practices and fostering biodiversity, we are creating a model of agriculture that prioritizes both environmental restoration and socio-economic sustainability. With an original goal to pilot regenerative agriculture in its own vineyards by 2025, Pernod Ricard is aiming to extend these initiatives to other crops, investing in both the land and communities it serves.\nPernod Ricard launched numerous initiatives globally to implement regenerative agriculture. In France, the company partners with farmers to integrate cover cropping and no-till practices, while in Ireland, it collaborates with barley growers to improve soil health and reduce chemical inputs. Our commitment is comprehensive and tailored, Morgane notes. Each terroir requires unique solutions. We cannot adopt a one-size-fits-all approach; instead, we focus on aligning with local realities to deliver impactful results.\nOne flagship project located in the Champagne region, where Gaël Dupont closely collaborates with Pernod Ricards Champagne Maisons Mumm and Perrier-Jouët. Since 2019, his family-run vineyard has been transitioning to regenerative practices. The use of cover crops has fundamentally changed the way we manage our vineyard, explains Gaël. Weve introduced species that not only protect the soil but also attract pollinators and improve biodiversity across the parcels.\nThe introduction of these practices has yielded positive results. The wines produced with one of our Chardonnay vineyards used to take seven or eight years to reach its peak, he adds. Now, within three years, the wines are well-balanced and ready to drink. Thats a tangible result of what regenerative practices can achieve.\nResponding to Gaëls observations, Morgane elaborates: The transformation we are witnessing in Champagne is a testament to the power of regenerative agriculture. By revitalizing soil health and fostering biodiversity, we are not only elevating the quality of our wines but also contributing to the resilience of local agricultural systems. This is a paradigm shift, where sustainability and profitability coexist.\nEconomic incentives are pivotal to this transition. Under a five-year contract, Pernod Ricard offers premiums to farmers embracing regenerative practices, helping to mitigate the financial risks of adopting new methods.\nThe financial support from Champagne Maisons Mumm et Perrier-Jouët has been critical. The premium we receive helps offset the initial costs of transition and gives us confidence to keep innovating. Gaël Dupont\nIn addition, peer-to-peer collaboration is key to transition. Sharing experiences with other viticulturists is essential, Gaël states. At first, you feel like an outsider, but through peer-to-peer exchanges, weve built a community where experimentation is encouraged.\nTracking progress through measurable outcomes drives advances in regenerative farming practices. Pernod Ricard tracks key indications such as soil carbon levels, water retention and greenhouse gas emissions across its pilot sites. The data allows us to refine our strategies and scale solutions that work, says Morgane. This evidence-based approach ensures that our actions deliver measurable benefits over the long term.\nAs a member of the OP2B coalition, Pernod Ricard collaborates with global leaders across sectors to establish standardized metrics and frameworks for regenerative agriculture.\nAligning methodologies and impact indicators is critical to driving systemic change. OP2B offers a unique platform to unify efforts and leverage collective intelligence to accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices. Morgane Yvergniaux\nThe coalitions efforts go beyond internal alignment, focusing on advocacy and industry-wide initiatives to amplify their collective impact. As Morgane emphasizes, Scaling regenerative agriculture requires a unified language and shared vision. We cannot act in silos if we are to tackle the global challenges of biodiversity loss and climate change. Looking ahead, Pernod Ricard is working on an impact tracking tool, which it will share with OP2B members to help optimize agricultural practices on a global scale.\nRegenerative agriculture is a critical solution to transform the way we produce food, feed and fiber, benefiting the climate, nature and people. Over the next few years, the OP2B coalition will focus on unlocking three strategic levers to scale up regenerative agriculture: harmonizing measurement, fostering collaborations to support farmers transition and advocating for policies that create an enabling environment.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334201/334201-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334201\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "On theMedtech POVpodcast,AdvaMed President and CEO Scott Whitaker sat down with recently retired U.S. Rep. Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, discussing lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, illogical budgetary scoring of health care procedures, and Wenstrups life-saving triage of U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Steve Scalise after a shooting.\nWenstrup is a podiatric surgeon, a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve, and an Iraqi War veteran. He served as the U.S. representative for Ohios 2ndcongressional district from 2013 to early 2025, with service on the Ways and Means and Intelligence committees. He chaired the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic and urged listeners to read the subcommittees finalreportrecommendations.\nTheyre nonpartisan. They just make sense for America, Wenstrup said. Those are the lessons learned from along the way. Im not trying to cast as much aspersion on those that were trying to do the right thing, but lets do better next time from the lessons learned.\nWenstrup was the lead Republican co-sponsor of the bipartisanEnsuring Patient Access to Critical Breakthrough Products Act, H.R. 1691 in the last Congress, to give Medicare beneficiaries faster access to safe, effective, FDA-designated breakthrough medical devices. The Ways and Means Committee approved the bill, and AdvaMed will seek re-introduction and enactment in the new Congress.\nWenstrup advocates for common sense in the congressional scoring and insurance coverage, including Medicare, of medical procedures and treatments. Current consideration downplays the cost savings of preventive measures and cures that might be costly at the outset but provide considerable cost savings over a patients life and even more importantly, restore the patient to wellness, Wenstrup said.\nWeve got to be patient centric, he said. There is a return on investment. If you have some new technology or innovation, that even if its a device for the rest of your life, but it allows you to go back and live your life and go to work and raise your family, thats a pretty good return on investment.\nWenstrup details his experience treating Scalise moments after Scalises shooting on a baseball field in 2017.\nSteve is such an amazing guy, Wenstrup said. Tremendous courage through all that, never complained, multiple surgeries and everything else, and he just keeps on going. He always says, oh, Brad, youre my hero, and Im like, no, you are mine, because I dont know how many people that have had the strength and courage that he has.\nTo hear the full conversation, download theMedtech POVpodcast onSpotify,Apple Podcastsor wherever podcast streaming is available.

        "article text": "I am deeply alarmed by the intensifying violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and its impact on children and families. In North and South Kivu provinces, we are receiving horrific reports of grave violations against children by parties to the conflict, including rape and other forms of sexual violence at levels surpassing anything we have seen in recent years.\nDuring the week of 27 January to 2 February 2025, UNICEF partners reported that the number of rape cases treated across 42 health facilities jumped five-fold in one week. Of those treated, 30 per cent were children. The true figures are likely much higher because so many survivors are reluctant to come forward. Our partners are running out of the drugs used to reduce the risk of HIV infection after a sexual assault.One mother recounted to our staff how her six daughters, the youngest just 12 years old, were systematically raped by armed men while searching for food.Children and families across much of the eastern DRC continue to face relentless bombardment and gunfire. In recent months, thousands of vulnerable children in displacement camps have been forced to flee multiple times to escape the fighting.Amid the chaos, hundreds of children have been separated from their families, exposing them to heightened risks of abduction, recruitment and use by armed groups, and sexual violence. In just the past two weeks, more than 1,100 unaccompanied children have been identified in North Kivu and South Kivu, with numbers continuing to rise.UNICEF staff are urgently working to register unaccompanied and separated children, place them with temporary foster families, and ensure that they receive essential medical and psychosocial care.Even before the recent intensification of the crisis, recruitment of children into armed groups was already on the rise in the region. Now, with parties to the conflict calling for the mobilization of young fighters, recruitment rates will likely accelerate. Reports indicate that children as young as 12 are being recruited or coerced into joining armed groups.Parties to the conflict must immediately cease and prevent grave rights violations against children. They must also take concrete measures to protect civilians and infrastructure critical to their survival  in line with their obligations under international humanitarian law.Humanitarian partners must have safe, unimpeded access to reach all children and families in need  wherever they may be. UNICEF continues to call for increased diplomatic efforts to put an end to the military escalation, and to forge a lasting political solution to the violence, so that the countrys children can live in peace.#####\nUNICEF, the United Nations agency for children, works to protect the rights of every child, everywhere, especially the most disadvantaged children and in the toughest places to reach. Across more than 190 countries and territories, we do whatever it takes to help children survive, thrive, and fulfil their potential.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334199/334199-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334199\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "The legacy of war and its persistent echoes in American foreign policy come to life in Alfredo Bonadeos book,No Lessons Learned: Vietnam The Fighting, The Dying, A Legacy Replayed in the Middle East.This essential read challenges the reader to reflect on the lasting costs of conflict and the pressing need for diplomatic solutions over military might.Alfredo Bonadeos life journey, from growing up in fascist Italy during World War II to his distinguished career as a professor of Italian Literature at the University of California, Santa Barbara, deeply shaped his perspective on war. His academic pursuits, centered on the literary exploration of warfare, and his personal experiences provided a deep, humanistic wisdom into the impacts of war. Inspired by the unfinished manuscript left behind at his passing in 2011, his wifeBarbara Bates Bonadeo, alongside colleague Harry Lawton, completed this vital work, adding contextual and contemporary reflections to Bonadeos original text.No Lessons Learnedlooks into the harrowing Vietnam War experience while drawing potent parallels to the American military engagements in the Middle East post-2001. Bonadeo argues that the lessons from Vietnam were tragically overlooked, resulting in repeated failures and continued suffering. The book meticulously examines the human and societal costs of war, advocating for diplomacy over force. It highlights the psychological toll on soldiers and civilians alike, stressing the importance of understanding the causes and consequences of war to prevent future conflicts.In a striking passage, Bonadeo reflects:The true cost of war is not measured in dollars or territorial gains but in the shattered lives and broken spirits left in its wake. The physical and psychological scars borne by soldiers and civilians alike are the enduring legacies of our failure to learn from history.This poignant observation underscores the books central thesis that without a shift toward diplomatic solutions, the cycle of violence and loss will continue unabated.No Lessons Learnedis not just a history book; it is a call to action. Alfredo Bonadeos masterful narrative invites readers to reconsider the efficacy of war as a tool of foreign policy. With fewer than 150 pages packed with rigorous research and compelling arguments, this accessible commentary appeals to both academics and general readers. Its timely message resonates in todays geopolitical climate, urging a reevaluation of interventionist strategies. By highlighting the personal stories and broader implications of war, Bonadeo makes a compelling case for change.Discover the lessons that history offers and the urgent need to heed them.No Lessons Learnedis a must-read for anyone interested in understanding the true costs of war and the imperative of pursuing peace through diplomacy.

        "article text": "Jean Hironsis an accomplished pastel artist and dedicated teacher, specializing in capturing landscapes and architecture with vibrant pastels. After a 30-year career at the Library of Congress, Jean transitioned into her passion for art, teaching pastel classes and inspiring students of all levels. Her book,Finding Your Style in Pastel,stems from her extensive experience in both painting and teaching, guiding artists to explore the full spectrum of possibilities within the pastel medium.Finding Your Style in Pastelis a comprehensive guide aimed at pastel artists of all skill levelsfrom beginners to advanced practitioners. The book breaks down the myriad of choices available to pastel artists, including techniques, tools, and styles, helping artists develop their unique signature. Hirons offers structured approaches, insightful exercises, and terminology shes developed to articulate her experiences with pastel. Readers will find a wealth of information, inspiration, and encouragement to embrace their intuitive creativity while navigating the versatile world of pastel painting.As artists, we have choices. There are very few rules that apply across the board. We can create highly realistic paintings, or perhaps more expressive paintings, or paintings that have very little basis in reality, including those that are totally nonrepresentational.

        "article text": "The International Air Transport Association (IATA) and 123Carbon announced a strategic collaboration to develop interoperability between their respective Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) registries. Interoperability will increase transparency, avoid emissions reporting errorsincluding double issuanceand streamline certificate management across SAF registries.\nThe collaboration between IATA and 123Carbon will focus on three key elements:\nUser trust is essential. The transparency that comes with interoperability will ensure that our registries can function cohesively to maximize SAFs potential to support aviations decarbonization. The broader the alignment among registry providers, the better. We welcome all entities active in this field to work with IATA and 123Carbon towards global interoperability between all registries, said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATAs Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.\n123Carbon is committed to establishing integrity and trust in the market for Environmental Attribute Certificates (EACs) within multi-modal transportation (e.g. air, sea, road & rail). With IATA, we have found a strong partner in the aviation sector that shares our beliefs. This collaboration allows SAF providers, airlines, freight forwarders, and corporate entities to utilize our platforms without the concern of double issuance, whilst managing their SAF certificates digitally on our platform, said Jeroen van Heiningen, Managing Director, 123Carbon.\nIATA and 123Carbon will seek engagement with other SAF stakeholders to join this initiative to deepen the interaction between registries.\nThe IATA SAF Registry will launch in April 2025 with the aim to facilitate the broadest possible use of SAF in aviations decarbonization by standardizing the market for SAF certificates. SAF certificates are issued after a SAF batch is registered and contains product and environmental attribute information. As part of its preparation for the Registrys launch, IATA recently released the IATASAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology.\nThe development of the IATA SAF Registry is supported by over 50 organizations, including airlines, fuel producers, and State authorities. In developing the IATA SAF Registry, IATA is also consulting with a broad range of SAF stakeholders, including 123Carbon.\nWith over 50 global users,123Carbonis the first independent platform for carbon insetting across all transport modes. It supports fuel suppliers, fleet operators, forwarders and cargo owners in the issuance, management and transfer of Environmental Attribute Certificates (EACs) across all modalities and all technologies, including SAF. Next to the central registry, 123Carbon also offers a private Book & Claim solution that SAF suppliers and airlines can use to allocate company-branded SAF certificates to their customers in a private environment. This is also regarded as a critical instrument for forwarders that operate across different transport modes and are seeking a single solution to allocate their environmental benefits.\nNotes for Editors:\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334175/334175-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334175\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "For a duration of two years, LEnvol des Pionniers, a cultural venue dedicated to the history of French aviation located in Toulouse, presents an exhibition entirely dedicated to Air France. An invitation to explore the companys history, from its origins in 1933 to the present day. To mark this event, Air France and LEnvol des Pionniers are also on display at Galeries Lafayette Toulouse, extending the experience to the heart of the pink city.\nAn immersive experience spanning over 90 years of history\nThe exhibition will include emblematic posters, model aircraft, couture uniforms, vintage seats, and more. This exhibition is an opportunity to showcase over 170 original objects making up Air Frances heritage, illustrating how the company has over the years invented a genuine French-style travel experience, down to the smallest detail.\nLEnvol des Pionniers also highlights the unique history of Air France in Toulouse. The companys heritage will be on display in its historic buildings that served as the base from where the airline operated for nearly 70 years.\nWith a fixed path layout highlighting the different eras, the exhibition which is accessible to all ages is grouped into four sections -\nThis exhibition showcases the wealth of Air Frances heritage and our ability to innovate and reinvent the pleasure of travel, with the elegance that characterizes our airlinesaid Fabien Pelous, SVP Air France Customer Experience.\nIts a great source of pride and a unique opportunity to showcase the history of Air France at one of the companys historic aircraft maintenance sites. Staging the exhibition Air France, a history of elegance at what is now the site of the LEnvol des Pionniers museum in Toulouse was an obvious choice for us,said Arnaud Mounier, CEO of LEnvol des Pionniers.\nAir France on display at the Galeries Lafayette Toulouse\nTo accompany the launch of the Air France, a history of elegance exhibition, the company and LEnvol des Pionniers are teaming up with the Galeries Lafayette Toulouse to offer Toulouse residents a glimpse of the exhibition in the department stores window display. Against a scenic background featuring imitation aircraft windows, passers-by can notably admire a range of iconic Air France uniforms, and emblematic vintage posters. Theres also an exclusive competition running until 2 March 2025, with the chance to win two plane tickets to one of seven destinations - Casablanca, Dakar, Rome, Tokyo, New York, Rio de Janeiro and London.\nAbout lEnvol des Pionniers and SEMECCEL\nDedicated to the early days of aviation, the creation of the Lignes Aériennes Latécoère and the Compagnie Générale Aéropostale, and then the birth of Air France, LEnvol des Pionniers is located in Toulouse Montaudran, on the historic site from where the Aéropostale planes set off for Africa and South America between 1918 and 1933. LEnvol des Pionniers tells the story of this incredible human adventure that contributed to the birth of civil aviation, and making Toulouse one of the worlds aeronautical capitals. LEnvol des Pionniers is a Toulouse Métropole facility, opened at the end of 2018 with the support of the Occitanie Pyrénées-Méditerranée Region and the FEDER (European Regional Development Fund) and with the participation of the French National Education Ministry and partners Altran, Ailes Anciennes de Toulouse and the French national audiovisual institute (INA).\nLEnvol des Pionniers is managed by SEMECCEL, a semi-public company created by the Toulouse City Hall, whose shareholders are Toulouse Métropole, Toulouse City Hall, the Occitanie Pyrénées-Méditerranée Region, French space agency CNES, Airbus Defense and Space, Météo-France (founding members of the Cité de lespace), as well as Thales Alenia Space, Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations and the Caisse dEpargne de Midi-Pyrénées.

        "article text": "SITA, the global leader in air transport technology, has launched an innovative new global messaging solution which will help redefine the way ATC communications works. SITA ATC Connect allows the sharing of flight information with air navigation service providers (ANSPs) quickly and securely worldwide. It provides streamlined communications to simplify the exchange of data and ensure flight operations run as smoothly and efficiently as possible.\nThe new messaging platform offers a single, easy-to-use global solution for airlines, airports and ground handlers to exchange flight operational messages with ANSPs. This can include flight plans, NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen) that alert pilots of potential hazards along a flight route or at a location that could affect their flight, and other essential advisories.\nSITA ATC Connect is easily integrated, fully supporting the move from legacy Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Networks (AFTNs) to modern ATS (Air Traffic Services) Messaging Handling Systems (AMHS). With full inter-operability, it allows service providers to share large file messages and images with enhanced features for rich data exchange.\nMartin Smillie, Senior Vice President for SITA Communications and Data Exchange (CDE) said: The mix of legacy and modern air traffic systems in different markets globally add unnecessary complexity and delays to air navigation. SITA ATC Connect automatically adapts to different air navigation communities worldwide with an innovative, single global communication connection that is both quick and secure. This is truly the future of ATC messaging, improving efficiency and allowing the industry to offer reliable and on-time operations.\nAirlines, airports and ground handlers exchange many messages with air navigation service providers for day-to-day flight operations. Customers using SITA ATC Connect enjoy seamless communications throughout the flight operations process while the solution makes all necessary conversions between AFTN and AMHS systems, adapting automatically to the required ANSP environment.\nSITA ATC Connect provides airlines, airports and ANSP customers with an easy-to-use system that provides direct access to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) AMHS ATC for a single point of transmission for flight plans and meteorological data, avoiding intermediary points to quickly secure real-time acknowledgements and responses.\nThe solution has a built-in back-up connection for uninterrupted service, with streamlined workflows for smoother daily operations that deliver time and resource savings through automation and simplified processes. It can also automatically reroute traffic to avoid operational disruptions or delays, while also covering both ICAO and IATA (International Air Transport Association) connectivity protocols and message formats for full compatibility and geographic coverage.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334171/334171-1.png)\nWebWireID334171\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "We issued our fourth quarter and full-year 2024 financial results. You can read the detailshere. Airbnb Co-Founder and CEO Brian Chesky said:\nIn 2024, we outpaced the travel industrys growth, with revenue, nights booked, and GBV all accelerating in Q4. This growth reflects the significant improvements weve made to Airbnbs usability, affordability, and reliabilityand were excited to build on this momentum in 2025.\nOver the past several years, weve been preparing for Airbnbs next chapter. Weve rebuilt our platform from the ground up on a new technology stack, and improved the overall user experience, with over 535 features and upgrades based on feedback from our guests and hosts. Today, our service is better than ever, and our platform is ready to support the new offerings well launch as part of our May 2025 Summer Release. While these efforts are setting us up for long-term growth, theyre already driving a positive impact on the business, which is evident from our Q4 results.\nNights growth accelerated in Q4 compared to Q3resulting in the highest-growth quarter of the year. This momentum allowed us to end 2024 with over 491 million Nights and Experiences Booked and nearly $82 billion of GBV. Revenue surpassed $11 billion in 2024 driven by strong demand and a modest increase in ADR, as well as our monetization efforts, including the expansion of our guest travel insurance and introduction of an additional service fee amount for cross-currency bookings. Adjusted EBITDA of $4.0 billion in 2024 increased 11% year-over-year and represented an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 36%. We also generated $4.5 billion of FCF in 2024, highlighting the strength of our cash-generating business model.\nAirbnb is a fundamentally stronger company today than it was several years ago. Since our 2020 IPO, our revenue and GBV have tripled, and in 2024, we successfully outpaced the travel industrys growth. Were continuing to build on this momentum in 2025, executing a multi-year strategy to perfect the core service, accelerate growth in global markets, and launch and scale new offerings.\nHeres a snapshot of our Q4 and full-year 2024 results:\nHosting on Airbnb is one of the best ways to make money from your home, but not everyone has the time to do it. Thats why we introduced Co-Host Network3, an easy way to find the best local co-hosts to help manage your Airbnb. Co-hosts provide personalized support based on hosts needs, from listing setup to managing bookings and communicating with guests. By helping take the work out of hosting, we believe well be able to unlock a significant amount of high-quality supply. In the four months since launching, Co-Host Network has grown to support almost 100,000 listings. These listings earn approximately twice as much as Airbnb listings in comparable countries4. We launched Co-Host Network in 10 countries, and are expanding it to Japan and Korea in the coming months.\nOur ambition is to perfect our core service. As part of this work, were continuously rolling out product optimizations to drive business growth. Recent initiatives include enhanced search functionality, better merchandising, flexible payment options, and the launch of local payment methods in nearly two dozen countries, including Brazil, Korea, and Indonesia. Collectively, these optimizations have contributed to higher conversion rates, and we expect to see the full benefits in 2025. In the year ahead, well begin delivering on an extensive roadmap of additional improvements.\nOver the past several years, weve rebuilt the Airbnb technology stack, including completely overhauling and modernizing the app experience. We introduced brand-new listing management tools, making it easier for hosts to list and manage their homes, while giving them the ability to offer more services in the future. Weve also upgraded our messaging system into a unified platform, making communication between guests and hosts more seamless. Were already seeing our investments in performance pay off with improved usability, which we know drives growth. With this new tech platform, we can innovate faster and expand beyond short-term rentals into an extensible platform with a range of new offerings.\n****\n1. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is provided at the end ofthe letter.\n2. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is provided at the end ofthe letter.\n3.Co-Host Network is available in the app and atairbnb.com/hostin 10 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, UK, and the U.S. Hosts on the Co‑Host Network typically have high ratings, low cancellation rates, and established Airbnb hosting experience. Ratings are based on guest reviews for listings they host or co‑host and may not represent the co‑hosts unique services.\n4.  Based on projected earnings of new active listings added through the Co-Host Network compared to other new active listings in comparable countries in 2024.\nAirbnb was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 5 million hosts who have welcomed over 2 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334157/334157-1.png)\nWebWireID334157\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "The use of augmented intelligence (AI)often called artificial intelligence in health care evokes greater enthusiasm and less apprehension than it once did among a growing number of physicians, according to anew survey(PDF) by the American Medical Association (AMA). However, many physicians are at a crossroads and remain guarded with their enthusiasm for health AI due to lingering concerns.\nThe latest edition of AMAs Augmented Intelligence Research survey examined changes in physician sentiment towards health care AI from August 2023 to November2024 and offers deep insight into evolving physician perspectives on the adoption and use of health AI.\nThe portion of physicians whose enthusiasm exceeded their concerns with health AI increased to 35% in 2024 from 30% in 2023. While the portion of physicians whose concerns exceeded their enthusiasm for health AI decreased to 25% in 2024 from 29% in 2023. Two in five physicians remain equally excited and concerned about health AI with almost no change between 2023 and 2024.\nThe AMA survey illustrates that physicians are increasingly intrigued by the assistive role of health AI and the potential of AI-enable tools to reduce administrative burdens, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and personalize treatments, said AMA Immediate Past President Jesse M. Ehrenfeld, M.D., M.P.H. But there remain unresolved physician concerns with the design of health AI and the potential of flawed AI-enabled tools to put privacy at risk, integrate poorly with EHR systems, offer incorrect conclusions or recommendations, and introduce new liability concerns. Increased oversight ranked as the top regulatory action needed to increase physician confidence and adoption of AI.\nAmong the key findings, the survey showed:\nThe AMAsworkcontinues to support the development of high-quality, clinically validated AI that is deployed in a responsible, ethical, and transparent manner with patient safety being the first and foremost concern. The AMA is dedicated to shaping a future that ensures only safe, high-quality, and unbiased AI products are brought to market and has issuedprinciples to guide the responsible development and deployment and use of AI(PDF), ensuring that these technologies contribute positively to the future of health care.\nThe American Medical Association is the physicians powerful ally in patient care. As the only medical association that convenes 190+ state and specialty medical societies and other critical stakeholders, the AMA represents physicians with a unified voice to all key players in health care.  The AMA leverages its strength by removing the obstacles that interfere with patient care, leading the charge to prevent chronic disease and confront public health crises and, driving the future of medicine to tackle the biggest challenges in health care.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/6/334150/334150-1.png)\nWebWireID334150\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

The built-in ethernet port and transmission technology allowed me to send images to our team of editors and out into the world within moments of the capturing the action. Additionally, the customization of the buttons and controls allowed for a seamless experience while working, especially during a big event like this when there is no time to be messing around.

Additionally, the C300 Mark III provided high 50-yard line shots.\nWe are very proud that Canons equipment and service support could contribute to the Big Game, which remains one of the worlds most prestigious sporting events, said Kiyoshi Oka, executive vice president and general manager for Canon U.S.A., Inc. Helping to provide the tools for photographers and broadcasters to document such an important moment for the culture is a privilege that means so much to us at Canon, and contributing to the enjoyment that millions of people derive from watching the game is a source of pride for our company.\nFor still photographers, the EOS R1 camera  geared toward professionals that brings together Canons cutting-edge technology and combines top-class performance with the strong durability and high reliability sought in a flagship model  again played a major role for a signature sporting event.\nWith more than 30 years of experience using Canon cameras, I couldnt be more pleased with the quality and reliability of their products, especially the new EOS R1, said Steve Sanders, Kansas Citys team photographer. As a professional who relies on all types of Canon gear every day, the versatility and outstanding quality of their equipment make Canon the clear choice for my team.\nWhenever we need assistance, the team at Canon Professional Services is always there for us, whether its for a cleaning, a loaner, or a repair, he added. The turnaround is so fast that we barely notice the gear is gone. As a professional, I cant imagine working with any other brand. With Canons support, I always feel confident that I can take any project to the next level.\nAdded Jamie Squire, Getty Images Chief Sports Photographer: This was the first time using the new Canon R1s during the Big Game and they performed beautifully. Even in lower lighting, shooting wide open at 2.8, the autofocus was fast and the images were crisp and razor sharp. The built-in ethernet port and transmission technology allowed me to send images to our team of editors and out into the world within moments of the capturing the action. Additionally, the customization of the buttons and controls allowed for a seamless experience while working, especially during a big event like this when there is no time to be messing around. The Canon system and the knowledge of how to use it provided me with the confidence to perform at my best.\nFor more information about Canons extensive lineup of professional imaging products, please visitwww.usa.canon.com/pro.\nAbout Canon U.S.A., Inc.\nCanon U.S.A., Inc. is a leading provider of consumer, business-to-business, and industrial digital imaging solutions to the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean markets.

        "article text": "BBC Scotland has commissioned Firecrest Films to produce a new two-part series examining the brutal crimes of Scottish serial killer Peter Tobin.\nThe Hunt for Peter Tobin is the third in the series of the award-winning true crime strand The Hunt for and follows the success of The Hunt for Bible John and The Hunt for the Worlds End Killers.\nIt follows the three separate investigations into young women who had seemingly vanished, and how they eventually revealed the existence of a serial killer targeting young women across the UK for more than three decades.\nVicky Hamilton was waiting for a bus on a snowy winter night in 1991 when the 15-year-old teenager disappeared. Her case became one of Scotlands biggest missing persons investigations. That summer 18-year-old Dinah McNicol vanished after hitchhiking home from a music festival in Kent. Then, 15 years later, 23-year-old Angelika Kluk went missing in Glasgow in 2006.\nThe series explores the ripple effects and the strain of their sudden disappearances on their families and friends of having a loved-one suddenly go missing. It includes interviews with family members, detectives, forensic scientists and journalists.\nLike the two previous Hunt For series, The Hunt for Peter Tobin is produced and directed by the multi-award winning team of film-maker Matt Pinder, and editors Audrey McColligan and Dave Clark.  The Hunt for Bible John was described by The Guardian as the best true-crime documentary of the year and by The Times as a chillingly brilliant piece of film-making.\nDavid Harron, Commissioning Executive, Factual at BBC Scotland says: This new series has the same distinguishing features to those that have gone before. It examines the Police investigations and the relentless pursuit of justice whilst at the same time telling the very real human stories which exist behind the headlines. It is this powerful combination, carefully crafted by the team, that makes for compelling viewing.\nMick McAvoy, Head of Documentaries at Firecrest Films said, Matt Pinder has once again produced a sensitively crafted series that reveals the brutal impact of a loved one suddenly going missing, while also paying tribute to the strength and compassion of those who devoted their lives to finding the truth about the disappearances. In the shadow of the brutal crimes of Peter Tobin, this series will inspire viewers as they see the tireless police work, the efforts of the Missing People charity and the strength of the families of the victims over three decades.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/7/334139/334139-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334139\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

Neither are expected to fall in love However, when they do, both Anna and David are forced to wrestle with what it means for them, their vows, and their relationship with God.\nFalling is a contemporary and deeply romantic drama that will surprise you in its study of faith in modern society as well as moving you to tears with its honesty and its heart.\nOllie Madden, Director of Film4 and Channel 4 Drama says:Falling is a beautifully observed, achingly romantic drama about two people who cant deny the feelings they have for one another, and yet battle with the crisis of faith their relationship triggers. Jack Thornes scripts are not only profoundly moving, but quietly subversive, witty, and revelatory in their examination of religion in contemporary society. We couldnt be more excited to collaborate with Jack, The Forge, and the brilliant Peter Hoar on this unique drama.\nGeorge Ormond, executive producer for The Forge says:Jack has created two central characters in Anna and David who feel deeply but hold their faith equally deeply.  That puts them in an impossible position and makes for a fantastically compelling, richly rewarding love story that is moving and insightful in equal measure.\nA 6x60 drama from The Forge,Fallingis executive produced by George Ormond, George Faber and Jack Thorne.

        "article text": "Replete with vivid colour, dynamic prints and high-octane silhouettes, the 25-piece resort-themed capsule collection imagines an aspirational vacation wardrobe that draws from the carefully curated wardrobes of this seasons characters. The array of eye-catching ensembles is designed to be layered and adapted for languid poolside days and memory-making nights.\nThe colours are infectious and upbeat  the promise of a good time  and the silhouette is voluminous, with soft and translucent fabrics adorned with ruffles that float in the summer breeze. Crochet and floral open-work, as well as motifs drawn as romantic lotus flower prints and playful elephants, evoke the lushness of the locale and that cinematic-style escapism that only travel can evoke.\nTo do a The White Lotus collection is to tap into a real cultural moment  it also meant we could create a glamorous and dreamy resort collection. I believe that as a person, you are more daring on vacation; you can have a different persona, and you communicate that in the way you dress. Theres that versatility, too, so you can pack light. It works for the beach, but you can easily style it for the evening if you want to. Its the perfect summer vacation wardrobe,\nsays Ann-Sofie Johansson, Creative Advisor at H&M.\nTheres something for every moment and mood, from the youthful 1960s-influenced babydoll dresses, boho crochet, and short-and-sweet lace looks to romantic long dresses and cover-ups. A long, billowing, high-neck shirred burgundy dress with rippling ruffles captures the high-drama spirit of the collection alongside a voluminous printed orange ruffle kaftan and a black-and-white halter-neck dress with a flounced hem. These vie for the spotlight alongside skin-baring silhouettes, like a long and flowing evening dress with cut-aways and sleek swimwear with plunging necklines.\nAn array of accessories enhances the vacation feeling. Woven hats and tote bags and gold-toned beaded and shell-pendant necklaces have that treasured feel of a local find, while sunglasses and slides finesse the high-summer look.\nI loved working with the team at H&M on the designs for the collection. We always have this little catchphrase on the show: Nothings too much for The White Lotus! So, Im drawn more to the bold patterns and the more sumptuous, billowing pieces. I love that the collection can be worn all day  something you could just throw on to go to breakfast or the pool, or you could add jewellery and wear it to dinner. Theres something for everyone.

        "article text": "NASAs Artemis campaign will send astronauts, payloads, and science experiments into deep space on NASAsSLS (Space Launch System)super heavy-lift Moon rocket. Starting with Artemis IV, the Orion spacecraft and its astronauts will be joined by other payloads atop an upgraded version of the SLS, called Block 1B. SLS Block 1B will deliver initial elements of a lunar space station designed to enable long term exploration of the lunar surface and pave the way for future journeys to Mars. To fly these advanced payloads, engineers at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, are building a cone-shaped adapter that is key to SLS Block 1B.\nThe payload adapter, nestled withinthe universal stage adaptersitting atop the SLS Block 1Bs exploration upper stage, acts as a connecting point to secure a large payload that is co-manifested  or flying along with  the Orion spacecraft. The adapter consists of eight composite panels with an aluminum honeycomb core and two aluminum rings.\nBeginning with theArtemis IV mission, SLS Block 1B will feature a new, more powerful upper stage that provides a substantial increase in payload mass, volume, and energy over the first variant of the rocket that is launching Artemis missions I through III. SLS Block 1B can send 84,000 pounds of payload  including both a crewed Orion spacecraft and a 10-metric ton (22,046 lbs.) co-manifested payload riding in a separate cargo compartment  to the Moon in a single launch.\nArtemis IVs co-manifested payload will be the Lunar I-Hab, one of the initial elements of theGateway lunar space station. Built by ESA (European Space Agency), the Lunar I-Hab provides expanded capability for astronauts to live, work, conduct science experiments, and prepare for their missions to the lunar surface.\nBefore the Artemis IV mission structure was finalized, NASA engineers needed to design and test the new payload adapter.\nWith SLS, theres an intent to have as much commonality between flights as possible, says Brent Gaddes, Lead for the Orion Stage Adapter and Payload Adapter in the SLS Spacecraft/Payload Integration & Evolution Office at NASA Marshall.\nHowever, with those payloads changing typically every flight, the connecting payload adapter must change as well.\nWe knew there needed to be a lot of flexibility to the payload adapter, and that we needed to be able to respond quickly in-house once the payloads were finalized, says Gaddes.\nThe required flexibility was not going to be satisfied with a one-size-fits-all approach, according to Gaddes.\nSince different size payload adapters could be needed, Marshall is using a flexible approach to assemble the payload adapter that eliminates the need for heavy and expensive tooling used to hold the parts in place during assembly.  A computer model of each completed part is created using a process called structured light scanning. The computer model provides the precise locations where holes need to be drilled to hold the parts together so that the completed payload adapter will be exactly the right size.\nStructured light has helped us reduce costs and increase flexibility on the payload adapter and allows us to pivot, says Gaddes. If the call came down to build a cargo version of SLS to launch 40 metric tons, for example, we can use our same tooling with the structured light approach to adapt to different sizes, whether thats for an adapter with a larger diameter thats shorter, or one with a smaller diameter thats longer. Its faster and cheaper.\nNASA Marshall engineers use an automated placement robot to manufacture eight lightweight composite panels from a graphite epoxy material. The robot performs fast, accurate lamination following preprogrammed paths, its high speed and precision resulting in lower cost and significantly faster production than other manufacturing methods.\nAt NASA Marshall, an engineering development unit of the payload has been successfully tested which demonstrated that it can handle up to three times the expected load. Another test version currently in development, called the qualification unit, will also be tested to NASA standards for composite structures to ensure that the flight unit will perform as expected.\nThe payload adapter is shaped like a cone, and historically, most of the development work on structures like this has been on cylinders, so thats one of the many reasons why testing it is so important, says Gaddes. NASA will test as high a load as possible to learn what produces structural failure. Any information we learn here will feed directly into the body of information NASA has pulled together over the years on how to analyze structures like this, and of course thats something thats shared with industry as well. Its a win for everybody.\nWith Artemis, NASA will explore more of the Moon than ever before, learn how to live and work away from home, and prepare for future human exploration of the Red Planet. NASAs SLS (Space Launch System) rocket, exploration ground systems, and Orion spacecraft, along with the human landing system, next-generation spacesuits, Gateway lunar space station, and future rovers are NASAs foundation for deep space exploration.\nFull Image Caption\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/334131/334131-1.png)\nWebWireID334131\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "GlobalData, a world-renowned consulting firm, released the 2024 Fiber to the Premise (FTTP) Competitive Landscape Assessment, which evaluates and ranks the OLT products of five top global vendors. Huaweis OptiXaccess MA5800T smart 10G OLT series (MA5800T series) scored the highest across all five dimensions measured: density/scalability, backplane/system throughput capacity, ONT range, deployment flexibility, and customer and market traction. This placed Huawei at No.1 in overall competitiveness and highlighted its position as the leader in the FTTP field.\nSpecializing in ICT data analysis and consulting,GlobalDatafocuses on ICT industry research and provides evaluation reports on areas such as market research and forecast and product analyses. In its 2024 FTTP assessment, the MA5800T series has shown outstanding performance in the following five scoring dimensions defined by GlobalData:\nDensity/Scalability\nAn OLT should have high density and scalability. Huaweis MA5800T series supports 8-/16-port symmetric/asymmetric triple-mode 50G PON with high-density deployment, meeting the access requirements for a large number of 10G users.\nBackplane/System Throughput Capacity\nAn OLT should have sufficient capacity to support upstream and downstream links. The Huawei MA5800T series supports 1 Tbps per slot, leading the industry.\nONT Range\nIt is important for an OLT to support various ONT models during FTTP deployment. The Huawei MA5800T series supports concurrent access of GPON, 10G PON, and 50G PON ONTs, as well as being compatible with GPON and 10G PON user access on the live network, offering strong protection for customers live network investments.\nDeployment Flexibility\nAn OLT should support the flexible deployment of different PON technologies and nodes of different scales. Huaweis MA5800T series is compatible with GPON, 10G PON, and 50G PON technologies. Furthermore, it provides an optical power budget up to 32 dB, and enables smooth upgrades without the need to change existing ODNs, thus maximizing return on investment (ROI).\nCustomer and Market Traction\nThe quantity, quality, and scale of cooperation with operators were all key scoring criteria in the GlobalData FTTP report. The Huawei MA5800T series has been tested and deployed by more than 60 operators, more than any other vendor. In addition, it is the only 50G PON OLT that can currently enter commercial use.\nHuaweis next-generation OptiXaccess MA5800T smart OLT series is the industrys first smart OLT platform designed for the 10G era. Featuring a deterministic experience, ultra-large bandwidth, smooth upgrades, and native intelligence, it provides operators and enterprises with the solutions they need to quickly and efficiently deploy premium FTTP networks, and drives the transformation from bandwidth to experience monetization.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/334120/334120-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334120\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "The New York Jets have informedAaron Rodgersthat they will be moving forward without the veteran quarterback after two seasons.\nLast week we met with Aaron and shared that our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback, Jets head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougeysaid in a statementreleased by the team. It was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures. We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward.\nNFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reports that Rodgers will likely be a post-June 1 release to help manage the cap hit. RapoportreportedSunday that Rodgers and the Jets appeared heading toward a split after two seasons.\nI personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets, Jets owner Woody Johnson said in a statement. His arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From day one, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans, and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here. He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next.\nRodgers arrived in New York to great fanfare in 2023 when the Jets acquired the four-time MVP quarterback in ablockbuster tradewith the Green Bay Packers. A few months later, the two sidesagreed to a new two-year, $75 million guaranteed contractthrough the 2024 season.\nRodgers was thought to be the missing piece to end the Jets postseason drought and to give the franchise consistent play at the QB spot after the failedSam DarnoldandZach Wilsoneras. But that was for naught as Rodgers tore his Achilles four plays into the 2023 season and then struggled to regain form in a disastrous 2024 that saw bothhead coach Robert Salehandgeneral manager Joe Douglasget fired midseason.\nRodgers, 41, ends his Jets career with 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions with a 6-12 record in 18 starts over two seasons.\nAround the NFL will have more on this news soon.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/334119/334119-1.png)\nWebWireID334119\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "article text": "Today, Apple is launching the Apple Health Study, which aims to further understand how technology  including iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods  can play a role in advancing and improving physical health, mental health, and overall wellbeing. Available in the Research app, the study will also explore relationships between various areas of health, such as mental healths impact on heart rate, or how sleep can influence exercise. The study is being conducted in collaboration with Brigham and Womens Hospital, a leading research hospital and a major teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School.\nWeve only just begun to scratch the surface of how technology can improve our understanding of human health, said Calum MacRae, M.D., Ph.D., a cardiologist, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and principal investigator of the Apple Health Study at Brigham and Womens Hospital. We are excited to be part of the Apple Health Study, as it will continue to explore connections across different areas of health using technology that so many people carry with them every day.\nIn medical research, discoveries are often limited by the number of participants who can be recruited, the amount of data that can be captured, and the duration of a given study  but Apple devices expand the possibilities. The Apple Health Study builds on learnings from theApple Womens Health Study, theApple Hearing Study, and theApple Heart and Movement Study, which combined have more than 350,000 participants across the U.S.\nThis new longitudinal, virtual study aims to understand how data from technology  including Apple and third-party devices  can be used to predict, detect, monitor, and manage changes in participants health. Additionally, researchers will explore connections across different areas of health. The study spans a number of health and disease areas, including activity, aging, cardiovascular health, circulatory health, cognition, hearing, menstrual health, mental health, metabolic health, mobility, neurologic health, respiratory health, sleep, and more.\nResearch and validation are part of the foundation of all of our work in health, supporting the innovative features we bring to our users across devices, said Sumbul Desai, M.D., Apples vice president of Health. The valuable insights weve gained since launching the Research app have allowed us to bring innovative new tools to our users  including the Vitals app on Apple Watch and Walking Steadiness on iPhone  and surface new insights in areas of health that have long been undervalued, like menstrual and hearing health. Were thrilled to bring forward the Apple Health Study, which will only accelerate our understanding of health and technology across the human body, both physically and mentally.\nThe Apple Health Study is designed to explore changes in health and how technology can help identify important insights for future product development. When one aspect of a persons health changes, their body can emit a signal, either physically or emotionally. Changes in health can affect one or more parts of the body, and others may affect wellbeing overall, so helping to identify these changes earlier can help offer a more proactive approach to health. For example, early detection of a change in hearing health could reduce the risk for cognitive decline.\nThe Apple Health Study is currently open for enrollment through theResearch appfor participants who live in the U.S., meet the minimum age requirements, and complete the informed consent process.\nThe Research app democratizes how medical research is conducted by bringing together academic medical institutions, healthcare organizations, and the Apple products users already make a part of their everyday life.1Participation is voluntary, and participants choose which data types theyd like to share with researchers, and are able to stop sharing at any time. Apple does not have access to identifying information, such as contact information that participants provide through the Research app. Participants can withdraw from any study at any time, ending future data collection.\n( Press Release Image:https://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/334117/334117-1.jpg)\nWebWireID334117\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.

        "headline": "BrightAI Expands Partnership with Pelsis to Bring AI-Driven Pest Control Solutions to Food and Pharma Production",
        "date": "2025-02-13",

        "article text": "BrightAI, a leader in physical AI for proactive infrastructure management, andPelsisGroup, the largest global manufacturer and distributor of pest control solutions, are advancing their collaboration with the rollout of more AI-powered pest management solutions for the food and pharmaceutical industries. Initially, the Pelsis Digital platform, developed in collaboration with BrightAI, was available in the popular Cobra LED insect light traps as part of a pilot program. Following the success of that pilot, Pelsis Digital Gen 2 technology will now be deployed in the Halo and Flytrap product lines, further automating and optimizing pest control across a broader range of facilities.BrightAI brings the power of AI to the physical world, solving complex real-world challenges like aging energy infrastructure, faulty HVAC systems, and damaged water pipes. Now, BrightAI is applying its technology to bring innovation to pest control.For food and pharmaceutical facilities, pest control is more than an operational concernit is essential to maintaining safety, preventing contamination, and complying with stringent regulatory standards. Even a small pest outbreak may result in reputational damage and can be a multimillion-dollar disaster waiting to happen, as contamination can trigger FDA inspections, production shutdowns, and supply chain chaos.Traditional pest control methods rely on manual inspections, often requiring technicians to access elevated areas to check insect light traps. This process can be disruptive, leading to downtime, posing health and safety risks, and sometimes missing early signs of infestation. As a result, potential issues may go undetected until they become more severe. According to the British Pest Control Association, it is estimated that up to 40% of the pest control workforce could retire within the next decade, putting pressure on the labor market and creating an urgent need for more efficient, technology-driven solutions to attract new talent and ensure continuity.BrightAI and Pelsis joined forces to introduce smart, AI-driven solutions that shift the strategy from reactive to proactive. Powered by BrightAIs Stateful OS technology, the platform operates on a simple yet effective cycle:\nMonitor:Pelsis digital insect light traps are equipped with BrightAIs cameras and sensors to provide 24/7, real-time monitoring, alerting operators to potential infestations before they escalate.\nDiagnose:The data captured trains advanced AI models that identify pest species and trends, allowing for tailoring treatment plans to the specific pestfor example, using different remediation strategies for fruit flies versus drain flies.\nAct:Actionable insights guide technicians to specific hotspots, allowing them to act on day one of detection, prevent outbreaks, reduce pesticide use, and keep food and pharmaceutical production running smoothly.\nAll of the data is collected in a web portal, a centralized platform for tracking pest trends, generating reports, and ensuring audit readiness across multiple sites. With this portal, pest control technicians or site managers can log in and see any glue board in any factory across the globe. The system also provides a mobile app that guides field technicians to specific glue boards and areas requiring intervention, optimizing response times to identify growing infestations before they become a problem.Pest control in food and pharma is about more than managing nuisancesits about safeguarding supply chains and protecting public health, said Alex Hawkinson, Founder and CEO of BrightAI. The stakes are incredibly high in these industries, where a few pests can trigger disastrous consequences. This expansion will put our AI-powered light trap product in more factories, enabling more businesses to take a proactive stance. Together with Pelsis, were arming companies with the tools to outsmart pest control challenges.Pelsis Digital has been deployed in several large-scale food and beverage manufacturing facilities and high-street grocery retailers across the US, UK, and Europe. Its adoption in these industries shows its value in ensuring compliance with strict hygiene and safety standards, which are critical in food production and retail environments. Additional benefits include more accurate data for auditing needs, reduced routine visits, fewer pesticides and safer workplace conditions for field technicians.The Pelsis Digital Halo product includes a new high-definition color camera, which provides an even better image quality and makes it easier to identify the specific species on the glue board. This product, along with the Cobra line, is also specifically designed for commercial environments, utilizing the latest LED light source technology that delivers energy savings of up to 69%.The feedback from food and pharmaceutical facilities has been overwhelmingly positive, said Claire Larcombe, Global Portfolio Director of Pelsis. Customers are seeing the immediate value in reducing operational risks and preventing costly downtime. This technology doesnt just solve problemsit stops them before they start, and were eager to see how it continues to elevate safety and efficiency in these critical industries.BrightAI and Pelsis are committed to close collaboration, enhancing their solutions based on customer feedback and continuously introducing improved features. Pelsis plans to expand the availability of its Pelsis Digital products to new markets in the Nordics, the Middle East and Asia, further broadening its global reach.For more information about BrightAI, please visithttps://www.bright.ai/.About BrightAI:BrightAI is a category-defining infrastructure AI company on a mission to transform global infrastructure from reactive to proactive management, setting a new standard in resilience and sustainability.
